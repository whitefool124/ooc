# Funplay Unity MCP Project Guidance

{CodexManagedNotice}

## Installed project skills

{string.Join("\n", installed.Select(skill => $"- `funplay-{skill.Id}` v{skill.Version} - {skill.Description}"))}

## Agent workflow rules

- Prefer project-local Funplay skills: `.codex/skills/` for Codex, `.opencode/skills/` for OpenCode, `.dsh/skills/` for DeepSeek Harness.
- Use `execute_code` as the primary Unity automation tool. For new snippets, include `using Funplay.Editor.Tools.Scripting;`, implement `IFunplayCommand`, and use `ctx.RegisterObjectCreation` / `RegisterObjectModification` / `DestroyObject` so changes participate in Undo automatically.
- Confirm the Unity project root, active scene, and real object/prefab/asset path before edits. Treat user-provided object names as hints, not paths.
- Inspect Unity objects through MCP before changing user-named scene or prefab targets. Carry the returned `instanceId` into follow-up calls (`find_method=by_id`) instead of re-resolving by name.
- Tool returns are structured JSON (`{{success, message, data}}` / `{{success: false, code, error, data}}`). Branch on `code`, not free-form text.
- Set component fields with `set_component_property(ies)` — it picks up `[SerializeField] private` fields and accepts Object references as `{{""fileID"": <instanceId>}}` or `{{""assetPath"": ""Assets/...""}}`.
- For field-only prefab asset edits, use `set_prefab_property(ies)` with a verified `Assets/**/*.prefab` path. If it reports duplicate paths or components, retry only with an index from that response; use Prefab Mode for structural edits.
- Read editor state through dedicated tools (`get_selection`, `get_prefab_stage`, `get_tags`, `get_layers`, `get_build_settings`); use `execute_menu_item` before falling back to ad-hoc `execute_code`.
- Never edit `.unity`, `.prefab`, or `.asset` files with shell text tools or patches; use Unity MCP / Editor APIs for scenes, prefabs, and ScriptableObject assets.
- Save only the scene or prefab assets intentionally modified, then read back exact values.
- With default `core` exposure, use the focused workflow tools. With default `full` exposure, prefer specific MCP tools for simple editor operations.
- `execute_code` refreshes the asset database and waits for compilation before running. For other tools that depend on freshly compiled code, still call `request_recompile` after external script edits.
- In `execute_code`, null-guard every lookup and return explicit missing path/object/component messages; do not run self-healing fallback loops.
- For Unity object references, do not use `??=` for lazy rebinding; use explicit `if (field == null) field = Resolve();`.
- After code or resource edits, exit Play Mode if needed, call `request_recompile`, `wait_for_compilation`, then read compilation or console errors.
- `request_recompile` is rejected while Unity is in Play Mode. Call `exit_play_mode` first, then retry.
- After `enter_play_mode`, the HTTP server briefly drops while Unity reloads the domain. Poll `tools/list` or `get_reload_recovery_status` until it responds again before issuing the next tool call.
- If recompilation triggers a domain reload or interrupts a request, treat the result as unknown until `get_reload_recovery_status`, compilation checks, and MCP readback confirm it.
- Avoid changing `Library/`, `Temp/`, `Logs/`, or `obj/`.

# Funplay Unity MCP Project Guidance

## Installed skills

{string.Join("\n", installed.Select(skill => $"- `{skill.Id}` v{skill.Version} - {skill.Description}"))}

## Preferred workflow

- Use Funplay MCP tools for Unity editor state and automation.
- Use `execute_code` for non-trivial Unity orchestration. For new snippets, include `using Funplay.Editor.Tools.Scripting;`, implement `IFunplayCommand`, and use `ctx.RegisterObjectCreation` / `RegisterObjectModification` / `DestroyObject` so changes participate in Undo and `ctx.Log` for traceable output.
- Confirm the Unity project root, active scene, and real object/prefab/asset path before edits. Treat user-provided object names as hints, not paths.
- Inspect Unity objects through MCP before changing user-named scene or prefab targets. Carry the returned `instanceId` into follow-up calls (`find_method=by_id`) instead of re-resolving by name.
- Tool returns are structured JSON (`{{success, message, data}}` / `{{success: false, code, error, data}}`). Branch on `code`, not free-form text.
- Set component fields with `set_component_property(ies)` — it picks up `[SerializeField] private` fields and accepts Object references as `{{""fileID"": <instanceId>}}` or `{{""assetPath"": ""Assets/...""}}`.
- For field-only prefab asset edits, use `set_prefab_property(ies)` with a verified `Assets/**/*.prefab` path. If it reports duplicate paths or components, retry only with an index from that response; use Prefab Mode for structural edits.
- Read editor state through `get_selection`, `get_prefab_stage`, `get_tags`, `get_layers`, `get_build_settings`; try `execute_menu_item` before writing ad-hoc `execute_code`.
- Never edit `.unity`, `.prefab`, or `.asset` files with shell text tools or patches; use Unity MCP / Editor APIs for scenes, prefabs, and ScriptableObject assets.
- Save only the scene or prefab assets intentionally modified, then read back exact values.
- With default `core` exposure, use the focused workflow tools. With default `full` exposure, prefer specific MCP tools for simple editor operations.
- `execute_code` refreshes assets and waits for compilation before running. For other tools that depend on freshly compiled code, still call `request_recompile` after external script edits.

- `request_recompile` is rejected while Unity is in Play Mode. Call `exit_play_mode` first, then retry.
- After `enter_play_mode`, the HTTP server briefly drops while Unity reloads the domain. Poll `tools/list` or `get_reload_recovery_status` until it responds again before issuing the next tool call.
- If domain reload interrupts a request, treat the result as unknown until `get_reload_recovery_status`, compilation checks, and MCP readback confirm it.
- If a Claude Code session reports another `funplay-*` MCP server entry as unreachable, check whether its name matches this project's own before treating Funplay as broken. Funplay registers one independent entry per Unity project, but Claude Code's connection check surfaces every registered entry on the machine regardless of which project the session is in — a different project's entry being disconnected is expected when that project's Editor isn't currently open, and it should not be deleted, since it may still be in active use by that project.
- Additional installed skills are available under `.claude/skills/`.

## Operating Loop

1. Inspect before editing.
   - Confirm the active scene, Canvas render mode, Canvas Scaler settings, EventSystem and input module, target orientations, design resolution, safe-area policy, and relevant prefab asset paths.
   - Inspect the existing hierarchy, anchors, pivots, offsets, layout controllers, sibling order, Canvas sorting, serialized references, animation targets, and Prefab overrides.
   - Inspect representative screens and prefabs to determine whether `UnityEngine.UI.Text` or `TextMeshProUGUI` is the project's prevailing text component, and inspect existing visual-effect components and material presets before introducing a new UI effect.
   - Treat screenshots and design coordinates as visual intent, not as permission to replace a working hierarchy.
2. Classify each region.
   - Mark art as full-bleed or safe-area content.
   - Mark placement as fixed to an edge or corner, stretched between regions, content-sized, repeated-layout content, scrollable content, modal, or world-space UI.
   - Decide which component owns each axis. One axis must not be driven concurrently by a Layout Group, ContentSizeFitter, AspectRatioFitter, animation, and manual code.
3. Make the smallest coherent change.
   - Preserve the prefab root, existing children, components, names, serialized references, animation bindings, and Prefab overrides unless a specific replacement is required.
   - Modify only the necessary RectTransforms, components, fields, and children. Do not recreate an entire UI or GameObject prefab unless the user explicitly requests a rebuild.
   - Author reusable user-facing screens, panels, and controls as prefabs with their hierarchy and component references wired in the Editor, then instantiate and bind data at runtime. Do not move a stable UI hierarchy into procedural runtime construction merely for implementation convenience.
   - Use Unity MCP or Unity Editor APIs for `.prefab`, `.unity`, and `.asset` changes; never patch Unity YAML as text.
4. Read back and validate.
   - Read exact hierarchy, anchors, offsets, sizes, sprites, text settings, raycast state, sorting, and references back from Unity.
   - Test layout, input, safe area, localization, animation interruption, close and reopen state, and runtime data changes.
   - Capture screenshots at representative aspect ratios. Use a real device build for performance and platform behavior before claiming device validation.

## Component Selection

| Component | Use it for | Configure deliberately | Avoid |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `Canvas` | Root render and sorting space | Use Screen Space - Overlay for ordinary HUD and menus, Screen Space - Camera when camera composition or scene interleaving is required, and World Space only for UI that belongs in the 3D world | Adding independent canvases only to organize folders; leaving Event Camera unset in Camera or World Space modes |
| `CanvasScaler` | Converting a design resolution to screen-space scale | For mobile screen UI, normally use Scale With Screen Size and a documented portrait or landscape reference resolution; choose Match from actual width and height constraints | Assuming Match `0.5` solves every aspect ratio or relying on Constant Physical Size without validating device DPI |
| `RectTransform` | Parent-relative position and size | Set anchors first, then pivot and offsets; keep local scale at one; use stretch anchors for flexible regions | Using anchoredPosition from one screenshot as universal placement or using Transform scale as a layout tool |
| `HorizontalLayoutGroup` / `VerticalLayoutGroup` | Dynamic rows, columns, button rails, and variable-length lists | Set padding, spacing, child size control, expansion, and child `LayoutElement` intent | Applying a Layout Group to hand-composed full-screen art or manually positioning driven children |
| `GridLayoutGroup` | Uniform inventory, level, or card cells | Choose cell size, spacing, start axis, and a row or column constraint | Expecting child preferred sizes to change grid cells; GridLayoutGroup assigns fixed cells |
| `LayoutElement` | Declaring minimum, preferred, flexible, or ignored layout behavior | Use it to override an Image, text, or nested group's layout contribution and to make selected siblings flexible | Adding it without selecting the properties that should override layout input |
| `ContentSizeFitter` | Making the current RectTransform follow its content on one or two axes | Prefer a single required axis; set the pivot to control growth direction; allow deferred layout unless immediate measurement is truly required | Putting it on every child controlled by a parent Layout Group or writing the same driven size manually |
| `AspectRatioFitter` | Preserving aspect for an isolated preview, card art, or media surface | Use Fit In Parent for letterboxing or Envelope Parent for cover behavior | Treating it as general safe-area or screen-aspect adaptation, or combining it with another controller on the same axis |
| `Image` | Sprite UI, icons, frames, progress fills, and nine-sliced controls | Use Simple for fixed art, Sliced for resizable bordered panels and buttons, Tiled for repeatable patterns, and Filled for progress or radial values | Stretching bordered art as Simple, leaving decorative graphics as Raycast Target, or using a unique material without need |
| `RawImage` | Arbitrary Texture, RenderTexture, camera, video, downloaded, or generated texture content | Preserve the source aspect and manage texture lifetime explicitly | Using RawImage for ordinary Sprite UI that should atlas and batch with other Images |
| `UnityEngine.UI.Text` | Text in an established legacy uGUI project or screen family | Use it only after inspection shows it is the prevailing project convention; match the existing Font, material, alignment, line spacing, overflow, and localization behavior | Introducing it into a new project, mixing it casually into a TMP-based screen, or converting existing labels without checking layout and serialized references |
| `TextMeshProUGUI` | Text in an established TMP project and the default for a new project with no existing text convention | Match the project's font assets and material presets; set wrapping, alignment, overflow, fallback fonts, and localization limits; constrain Auto Size to a narrow range; when the design explicitly shows a text effect, use TMP's own component and shader-material controls | Replacing an established `Text` component merely to modernize, continuous Auto Size on rapidly changing text, or shipping without required CJK and symbol glyphs |
| TMP font material / material preset | An outline, underlay or shadow, glow, face dilation, softness, or other text treatment explicitly visible in the design for a `TextMeshProUGUI` project | For a simple outline set the TMP component's `outlineColor` and `outlineWidth`; for underlay, glow, or other shader effects reuse an approved project preset or create a dedicated preset or material instance and verify it with fallback fonts | Adding a uGUI `Outline` or `Shadow` to TMP text by habit, changing a shared `fontSharedMaterial` and unintentionally restyling other labels, or enabling effects absent from the design |
| `Outline` / `Shadow` / similar `BaseMeshEffect` | A specifically designed effect on legacy `UnityEngine.UI.Text` or another Graphic, when required by the design or established project style | Reuse the project's approved style and keep effect distance, color, alpha, and stacking minimal; verify legibility and cost on target hardware; prefer TMP-native effects when the text component is `TextMeshProUGUI` | Adding generic polish by default, stacking effects, applying them broadly, or using them to compensate for weak contrast or incorrect layout; these effects duplicate UI geometry and increase overdraw |
| `TMP_InputField` | Editable TMP text | Author and validate a prefab with `textComponent`, `textViewport`, `placeholder` when used, target Graphic, navigation, and input settings already serialized; instantiate the prefab and bind data or listeners at runtime | Rebuilding a stable input hierarchy in code; if dynamic construction is genuinely required, never add it to an active GameObject and bind `textComponent` afterward because affected TMP versions create the caret renderer in `OnEnable` only when that reference is already present |
| `ScrollRect` | Drag or wheel scrolling through content larger than a viewport | Use `ScrollRect -> Viewport + RectMask2D -> Content`, reference both Viewport and Content, enable only required axes, and choose Clamped or Elastic intentionally | Unrestricted movement without recovery, deeply nested competing scroll axes, or instantiating thousands of live rows without virtualization |
| `RectMask2D` | Rectangular clipping in 2D Canvas UI | Prefer it for scroll viewports and rectangular reveal areas | Using stencil `Mask` for a simple rectangle |
| `Mask` | Clipping to a non-rectangular Graphic shape | Use only when the shape matters and account for stencil and material cost | Deeply nested masks or using it where RectMask2D is sufficient |
| `CanvasGroup` | Fading and enabling or disabling a whole panel | Change alpha, interactable, and blocksRaycasts together according to visible state; decide whether parent groups apply | Setting alpha to zero while leaving an invisible panel interactive or raycast-blocking |
| `Button` and other `Selectable` controls | Click, toggle, slider, dropdown, and navigation behavior | Put the main Raycast Target on the interactive root, set Target Graphic and navigation, and add and remove runtime listeners symmetrically | Multiple child Raycast Targets for one control, duplicate listeners, or visual-only disabled states |
| `EventSystem` and `GraphicRaycaster` | Routing pointer, touch, submit, cancel, and navigation events | Keep one EventSystem and one active matching input module; use `InputSystemUIInputModule` with the Input System; enable raycast only where required | A second EventSystem in additive scenes or physics blocking checks when they are unnecessary |

## Canvas And Layering

- Use a small number of semantic layers such as Background, Screen, HUD, Overlay, Modal, Loading, and Debug. Make each layer a full-stretch RectTransform and define sibling or sorting order once.
- Let opaque or decorative backgrounds bleed to the physical screen edges. Put critical labels and all interactive controls under a separate SafeAreaRoot.
- When Modal or Loading UI is visible, block gameplay input explicitly; a visible scrim alone does not prove input is blocked.
- Keep one stable scrim per popup layer when a popup stack owns it. Restore the previous popup and its input state when the top popup closes.
- Distinguish Hide from Close. Hide can retain a cached instance; Close must release instantiated assets, handles, listeners, and transient state.
- Split static and frequently changing UI only when profiling shows rebuild cost. Nested canvases isolate rebuilds but prevent batching across canvas boundaries, so do not create one Canvas per widget.

## Canvas Scaler And RectTransform Rules

- Treat the reference resolution as design coordinates, not a list of supported physical resolutions. A proven portrait baseline is `720 x 1559`; a proven landscape baseline is `1559 x 720`.
- Start with Scale With Screen Size and Match `0.5` when width and height are equally important, then verify. Move Match toward width when horizontal design width must remain stable, or toward height when vertical design height must remain stable.
- Use anchors to express attachment: top bars to top stretch, bottom actions to bottom or bottom stretch, edge buttons to their corner, and center gameplay viewports to stretch between reserved regions.
- Set anchors before recording offsets. With separated anchors, `sizeDelta` is the delta relative to the anchor rectangle, not the final absolute size.
- Resize UI through RectTransform width, height, anchors, and offsets; leave localScale at one. Animate a child named Visual or Container when the root is layout-driven.
- Respond to `OnRectTransformDimensionsChange` or an equivalent resolution and orientation signal when layout contains calculated page widths, aspect branches, or safe-area anchors. Do not poll and rewrite every RectTransform every frame.
- Prefer `LayoutRebuilder.MarkLayoutForRebuild` for deferred updates. Use `Canvas.ForceUpdateCanvases` or `LayoutRebuilder.ForceRebuildLayoutImmediate` only when code must measure the final layout in the same operation, never as a routine per-frame fix.

## Safe Area

- Read `Screen.safeArea` in screen pixels and convert both minimum and maximum corners to normalized anchors. Reapply when screen dimensions, orientation, or safe area changes; do not cache only a top inset.
- A minimal uGUI conversion is:

```csharp
Rect safe = Screen.safeArea;
safeAreaRoot.anchorMin = new Vector2(
    safe.xMin / Screen.width,
    safe.yMin / Screen.height);
safeAreaRoot.anchorMax = new Vector2(
    safe.xMax / Screen.width,
    safe.yMax / Screen.height);
safeAreaRoot.offsetMin = Vector2.zero;
safeAreaRoot.offsetMax = Vector2.zero;
```

- Guard zero screen dimensions and avoid duplicate application when nothing changed.
- Check `PlayerSettings.Android.renderOutsideSafeArea`. If rendering outside is disabled, the Player window can already be fitted to the safe area and `Screen.safeArea` can equal the full Player window; do not apply a second inset blindly.
- In portrait, verify top cutout and bottom home-indicator or navigation areas. In landscape, verify both left and right cutouts in Landscape Left and Landscape Right.
- For edge art assembled from nested images, particles, labels, or Spine content, wait until layout and final offsets are applied, then use `RectTransformUtility.CalculateRelativeRectTransformBounds(parent, visualRoot)` to clamp the complete visual bounds inside the allowed safe rectangle.

## Portrait Mobile Pattern

- Organize the screen as Top, Center, and Bottom regions. Anchor persistent status and currency UI to Top; navigation, primary actions, and skill buttons to Bottom; stretch the game or page viewport through Center.
- Reserve top and bottom space with offsets on the stretched center viewport instead of giving the viewport a fixed height.
- Let additional height on tall phones expand the center region. Do not multiply every vertical coordinate by the screen aspect ratio.
- For horizontally paged home screens, compute each page from the current viewport width and recompute content width and selected-page position when dimensions change.
- Keep centered popup content within a safe maximum height. Use scrolling for localized or data-driven content that can exceed that height.

## Landscape Mobile Pattern

- Organize the screen as Left, Center, Right, plus stable corners. Put high-frequency gameplay content in Center and distribute controls so neither side becomes a single crowded column.
- Use 16:9 as a common gameplay baseline, but branch deliberately for ultrawide, 16:10, and 4:3 tablet layouts. Anchors handle attachment; a small aspect-aware layout policy handles genuine composition changes.
- Keep camera framing separate from Canvas scaling. A narrow landscape viewport may require a larger orthographic size or alternate camera composition to preserve world-space gameplay even when the Canvas itself is correct.
- Use background cover scaling or phone and tablet background variants when one crop cannot preserve the art direction across 16:9 and 4:3.
- Reposition only the controls whose composition genuinely changes at tablet aspect ratios. Do not fork the entire screen prefab when a few region offsets or constraints are sufficient.

## Auto Layout And Dynamic Content

- Remember the allocation order: minimum size, then preferred size, then flexible size. Use `LayoutElement` to state which sibling can consume extra space.
- A Layout Group drives its children. Do not manually edit a driven child position or size and expect it to persist after the next rebuild.
- A ContentSizeFitter drives its own RectTransform and expands around its pivot. Use a top pivot for content that must grow downward and a left pivot for content that must grow rightward.
- Do not put ContentSizeFitter on children whose RectTransforms are already controlled by the parent Layout Group. Disable Child Force Expand and use child layout input instead.
- GridLayoutGroup ignores child minimum, preferred, and flexible dimensions and assigns the configured fixed cell size. Use a different layout or custom controller for variable-sized grid cells.
- Keep layout nesting shallow. Repeated layout invalidation walks the hierarchy; batch model changes, update content, then request one rebuild.

## Images, Text, Scrolling, And Input

- Use Sprite borders and Image Type Sliced for scalable button and panel frames. Keep ornamental children non-raycastable.
- Use Sprite Atlas for compatible UI sprites, platform-specific texture overrides, sensible maximum sizes, and no mipmaps for ordinary screen-space UI unless a measured use case needs them.
- Treat large full-screen images separately from small control atlases. Verify memory, compression artifacts, overdraw, and crop behavior on target hardware.
- Before adding a label, inspect representative UI prefabs and scenes rather than inferring the text system from package availability. Preserve the component type on existing labels and use the text component that is most common in the relevant project or screen family. If the project is new and has no established convention, default to `TextMeshProUGUI`.
- Do not opportunistically migrate `UnityEngine.UI.Text` to `TextMeshProUGUI`, or the reverse, while composing unrelated UI. Such a migration can change preferred sizes, wrapping, materials, fallback behavior, animation bindings, and serialized component references and requires separate validation.
- In TMP projects, use font fallback chains for CJK, symbols, and localized glyphs. Keep common glyphs in the primary asset and verify fallback material appearance and draw-call impact.
- Prefer wrapping, truncation, or a known layout expansion policy over broad Auto Size ranges. TMP Auto Size performs repeated layout passes and is unsuitable for frequently changing counters or timers.
- Do not add `Outline`, `Shadow`, or another `BaseMeshEffect` merely because a control looks unfinished. Require an explicit design need or a verified existing project style, prefer the existing shared prefab or TMP material preset when applicable, avoid stacked effects, and verify the extra geometry and overdraw.
- When the reference image or design explicitly shows an outline or another font effect and the project uses `TextMeshProUGUI`, reproduce the visible treatment through the TMP component rather than omitting it or attaching a uGUI mesh effect by habit. Use `outlineColor` and `outlineWidth` for a simple outline; use an existing approved TMP material preset, or a dedicated preset or material instance, for underlay or shadow, glow, face dilation, softness, and other shader effects.
- Treat TMP material scope as part of the edit. Do not modify a shared `fontSharedMaterial` when the effect is local to one label or prefab because every user of that material may change. Reuse a matching project preset when one exists; otherwise create a deliberately scoped preset or instance, preserve the font atlas and fallback chain, and verify the result against the reference at target resolution.
- Prefer a prefab for `TMP_InputField` and other stable controls so hierarchy, references, navigation, styling, localization, and focus behavior are inspectable before Play Mode. Runtime code should instantiate the prefab and supply data and listeners, not recreate its child objects and component wiring.
- Only when procedural construction is explicitly required, treat the first enable of a runtime-created `TMP_InputField` as an initialization boundary. Create and wire its text hierarchy while the root is inactive (or the component is disabled), assign at least `textComponent` and `textViewport` plus `placeholder` when used, then enable it. In affected TMP versions, `OnEnable` creates the cached `Caret` renderer only when `textComponent` is already bound; assigning the property after that first enable does not retroactively create it.
- If a dynamically constructed `TMP_InputField` accepts text but shows no insertion caret, inspect whether a `Caret` / `TMP_SelectionCaret` object was created and whether `textComponent` was assigned before first enable. After wiring the missing references, disable and re-enable the field to run initialization again; then verify focus, blinking caret, selection highlight, placeholder state, and editing in Play Mode.
- For a vertical ScrollRect, top-anchor the Content and set its pivot to the top so growth is predictable. Preserve the normalized position intentionally when refreshing content.
- Use RectMask2D for rectangular viewports. Use Mask only when the clipping shape must follow a Graphic.
- Give touch controls a project-defined minimum hit area even when the visible art is smaller. Use one transparent or visible root Graphic or raycast padding rather than making every child Image a target.
- Add listeners once and remove them in the matching lifecycle. Disable interaction while entrance or exit animation makes a control visually unavailable.

## Animation And Prefab Safety

- Animate a popup Container or Visual child while leaving the full-screen scrim stable. This avoids scaling the raycast blocker and avoids fighting layout-driven roots.
- Before replaying an animation, kill or cancel the prior sequence and restore a deterministic base position, scale, alpha, interactable, and blocksRaycasts state.
- Use unscaled time for menu, pause, modal, and loading animations that must continue while gameplay time is zero.
- Preserve existing prefab objects by default. Replacing an asset at the same path can preserve the asset GUID while still changing child or component file IDs, breaking animation bindings, serialized references, Prefab Variants, and Scene overrides.
- Prefer serialized references or stable binding components. Use `Transform.Find` only for a verified stable hierarchy and fail clearly if it is missing; never silently create an alternate hierarchy.
- Use semantic names such as SafeAreaRoot, TopBar, ContentViewport, BottomActions, Visual, and Label. Replace ambiguous default names only when doing so will not break bindings, and update references atomically.

## Performance And Validation

- Profile before restructuring. Common uGUI bottlenecks are overdraw, Canvas batch rebuilds, repeated layout rebuilds, raycast candidates, text mesh generation, and excess materials or textures.
- Separate mostly static UI from high-frequency counters, timers, scrolling content, or animations when profiling justifies the extra Canvas. Co-locate elements that change together.
- Disable Raycast Target on decorative Images and TMP text. An active Graphic Raycaster tests eligible Graphics and raycast filters along their hierarchy.
- Avoid hiding large inactive screens only with alpha zero; they can still render or receive input depending on CanvasGroup state. Use the project's hide or pooling policy and measure reopen cost.
- Validate portrait at 16:9, 19.5:9 or 20:9, a cutout phone, and a portrait tablet. Validate landscape at 16:9, ultrawide, 16:10, 4:3, and both cutout sides.
- In every profile, verify full-bleed art, safe interactive content, text overflow and fallback glyphs, scroll bounds, modal input blocking, touch hit areas, selection navigation, animation interruption, and close and reopen state.
- Use Device Simulator for layout, safe-area, orientation, and basic single-touch checks. It does not simulate target CPU, GPU, memory, rendering backend, native plugins, or multitouch; use representative device builds for performance and final interaction validation.

## Operating Loop

1. Establish context.
   - Confirm the Unity project root and active scene.
   - Check that Unity MCP is reachable before assuming Editor state.
   - Inspect hierarchy, prefab paths, selected objects, and relevant component references through MCP.
   - If the user names an object, treat the name as a hint and verify the real Unity object path before editing.
2. Choose the edit surface.
   - Edit source files with normal repo tools, then trigger Unity recompilation.
   - Edit scene objects through Unity APIs, mark the scene dirty, and save the scene.
   - Edit prefab fields with `set_prefab_property(ies)` when available. Use `PrefabUtility.LoadPrefabContents`, `SaveAsPrefabAsset`, and `UnloadPrefabContents` for structural changes.
   - Unless the user explicitly requests a full rebuild, preserve the existing hierarchy when editing UI or GameObject prefabs and modify only the required objects, components, and serialized fields; do not recreate the entire prefab.
   - Edit ScriptableObject assets through `SerializedObject`, `EditorUtility.SetDirty`, and `AssetDatabase.SaveAssetIfDirty` / `SaveAssets`.
   - Never patch `.unity`, `.prefab`, or `.asset` YAML with shell text tools.
   - If the user is looking at an open scene instance, update the visible scene instance as well as the prefab asset when appropriate.
3. Execute changes.
   - Prefer one well-guarded `execute_code` batch over many fragile UI clicks.
   - Use null guards for every object, component, asset, and path lookup.
   - Return explicit missing-path/object/component messages that include the expected path and the scene or prefab searched.
   - Return concise before/after values from snippets.
   - Save only the assets or scenes intentionally modified.
   - Do not run self-healing fallback loops; if a reference, path, package, or tool is missing, report it once and stop or skip that item.
4. Validate.
   - Read back the changed objects through MCP.
   - For code or resource edits, exit Play Mode if needed, call `request_recompile`, call `wait_for_compilation`, then inspect compilation errors and console errors.
   - For runtime behavior, enter Play Mode or inspect live objects when needed.
   - If MCP is unreachable, do not claim scene, prefab, asset, or runtime verification.
   - Report exactly what was verified and what still requires device, store, network, or manual validation.

## Unity Serialized Asset Safety

- Do not use shell text tools, scripts, or patches to modify `.unity`, `.prefab`, or `.asset` files. These are Unity-owned serialized assets; changing them outside Unity can corrupt file IDs, prefab overrides, references, import state, or scene dirtiness.
- Shell tools may inspect or locate serialized Unity assets, but scene, prefab, and ScriptableObject modifications must go through Unity MCP tools or Editor APIs.
- For scenes, modify live objects through Unity APIs, mark only the touched scene dirty, and save that scene.
- For prefabs, use Prefab Mode tools or `PrefabUtility.LoadPrefabContents` / `SaveAsPrefabAsset` / `UnloadPrefabContents`.
- For ScriptableObjects or other `.asset` files, load the asset with `AssetDatabase`, modify serialized properties through `SerializedObject` when possible, mark that asset dirty, and save only that asset.
- If Unity readback and raw file text disagree, trust Unity readback and investigate the asset path instead of hand-editing YAML.

## Tool Exposure

- With the default `core` profile, rely on the focused workflow tools: `execute_code`, recompilation, Play Mode control, hierarchy, console logs, screenshots, input simulation, and performance inspection.
- With the default `full` profile, prefer specific MCP tools for simple scene, asset, GameObject, component, prefab, camera, UI, package, animation, file, or visual-feedback operations.
- If Tool Exposure is customized and a named tool is unavailable, adapt to the exposed tool list and report which expected tool is missing.

## MCP Call Pattern

If native MCP tools are not directly available, probe the local HTTP endpoint. The port is
per project, so read it from the Funplay MCP Server window (it is also the port in the
configured client entry) instead of assuming a fixed one:

```bash
PORT=24312 # replace with the port shown in the Funplay MCP Server window
curl -sS -m 1 -X POST http://127.0.0.1:$PORT/mcp \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{""jsonrpc"":""2.0"",""id"":1,""method"":""tools/list""}'
```

For multi-line `execute_code` calls over curl, generate JSON with a real encoder instead of hand-escaping C#:

```bash
node - <<'NODE'
const code = String.raw`
using UnityEngine;

public class InspectSomething
{
    public static string Run()
    {
        var obj = GameObject.Find(""PracticeInGameUiRoot"");
        return obj != null ? obj.name : ""not found"";
    }
}
`;
const payload = {
  jsonrpc: ""2.0"",
  id: 1,
  method: ""tools/call"",
  params: { name: ""execute_code"", arguments: { code } }
};
process.stdout.write(JSON.stringify(payload));
NODE
```

## Recommended `execute_code` Template

For non-trivial snippets, prefer `IFunplayCommand` over the legacy `public static string Run()` template. `execute_code` auto-adds `using Funplay.Editor.Tools.Scripting;` when `IFunplayCommand` is used, but include it explicitly in generated snippets for readability:

```csharp
using Funplay.Editor.Tools.Scripting;
using UnityEngine;

public class CommandScript : IFunplayCommand
{
    public void Execute(ExecutionContext ctx)
    {
        var root = GameObject.Find(""PracticeInGameUiRoot"");
        if (root == null)
        {
            ctx.LogWarning(""PracticeInGameUiRoot not found"");
            ctx.ReturnValue = ""missing root"";
            return;
        }

        ctx.RegisterObjectModification(root);
        ctx.Log(""Found {0}, active={1}"", root.name, root.activeInHierarchy);
        ctx.ReturnValue = new
        {
            name = root.name,
            active = root.activeInHierarchy
        };
    }
}
```

Use `ctx.RegisterObjectCreation(obj)`, `ctx.RegisterObjectModification(obj)`, and `ctx.DestroyObject(obj)` instead of direct Undo calls when possible. Use `ctx.Log`, `ctx.LogWarning`, and `ctx.LogError` for output returned in the MCP response without polluting the Unity Console.

## Unity C# Patterns

Add explicit `using` directives or use fully qualified types for project code. `execute_code` does not auto-inject project namespaces by default:

```csharp
var root = UnityEngine.GameObject.Find(""PracticeInGameUiRoot"");
var rect = root.GetComponent<UnityEngine.RectTransform>();
```

Use Unity null semantics for `UnityEngine.Object` references:

```csharp

Do not use `??=` to lazily resolve or rebind `UnityEngine.Object` references. Unity's destroyed or unbound serialized references can be fake-null: `field == null` returns true through Unity's overloaded operator, while C# `??=` can still treat the managed wrapper as non-null and skip the fallback assignment. Use an explicit Unity-null check instead:

```csharp
if (_hud == null)
{
    _hud = GetComponentInChildren<MyHud>(true);
}
```

For prefab edits:

```csharp
var path = ""Assets/MyGame/UI/Prefabs/PF_PracticeInGameUiRoot.prefab"";
var prefab = UnityEditor.PrefabUtility.LoadPrefabContents(path);
try
{
    var target = prefab.transform.Find(""SafeArea/SwingCancelZone"");
    if (target == null)
    {
        return ""SwingCancelZone not found in prefab"";
    }

    var rect = target.GetComponent<UnityEngine.RectTransform>();
    var before = rect.anchoredPosition;
    rect.anchoredPosition = new UnityEngine.Vector2(-76f, 448f);

    UnityEditor.EditorUtility.SetDirty(rect);
    UnityEditor.PrefabUtility.SaveAsPrefabAsset(prefab, path);
    UnityEditor.AssetDatabase.SaveAssets();
    return ""Prefab saved: pos "" + before + "" -> "" + rect.anchoredPosition;
}
finally
{
    UnityEditor.PrefabUtility.UnloadPrefabContents(prefab);
}
```

For scene edits:

```csharp
var obj = UnityEngine.GameObject.Find(""PracticeInGameUiRoot/SafeArea/SwingCancelZone"");
if (obj == null)
{
    return ""Scene object not found"";
}

var rect = obj.GetComponent<UnityEngine.RectTransform>();
var before = rect.sizeDelta;
UnityEditor.Undo.RecordObject(rect, ""Update cancel zone"");
rect.sizeDelta = new UnityEngine.Vector2(220f, 116f);
UnityEditor.EditorUtility.SetDirty(rect);
UnityEditor.SceneManagement.EditorSceneManager.MarkSceneDirty(obj.scene);
UnityEditor.SceneManagement.EditorSceneManager.SaveScene(obj.scene);
return ""Scene saved: size "" + before + "" -> "" + rect.sizeDelta;
```

## Recompile And Reload

After external C# or asset file edits:

1. If Unity is in Play Mode, call `exit_play_mode` first — `request_recompile` is rejected during play because Unity does not run script compilation or domain reloads while playing.
2. Call `request_recompile`.
3. Call `wait_for_compilation`.
4. Read `get_compilation_errors` and `get_console_logs` errors before continuing.
5. If a domain reload drops or interrupts the request, call `get_reload_recovery_status` when available, re-scan the MCP endpoint if needed, then continue from `wait_for_compilation`.

Do not treat a disconnected, interrupted, or domain-reload-recovered request as a successful compile or edit. It only means the state is unknown until compilation checks and MCP readback confirm the final values.

After `enter_play_mode`, the HTTP server is briefly unreachable while Unity reloads the domain. Before issuing the next tool call, poll a cheap endpoint such as `tools/list` (or `get_reload_recovery_status` if exposed) until you get a response — do not assume the connection survives the Play Mode transition.

## Verification Checklist

Use readback snippets that print exact values, not only `success`:

```csharp
var all = UnityEngine.Resources.FindObjectsOfTypeAll<UnityEngine.Transform>();
UnityEngine.Transform target = null;
for (int i = 0; i < all.Length; i++)
{
    if (all[i].name == ""SwingCancelZone"")
    {
        target = all[i];
        break;
    }
}

if (target == null)
{
    return ""SwingCancelZone not found"";
}

var rect = target.GetComponent<UnityEngine.RectTransform>();
return ""path="" + target.name + ""; pos="" + rect.anchoredPosition + ""; size="" + rect.sizeDelta;
```

For UI work, verify prefab or scene hierarchy, sprite references, anchors, sorting order, active state, text fit, and button listeners. A populated `Content` hierarchy does not prove the user can see the UI.

For gameplay or network work, verify object identity, ownership, live instance existence, transform values, animation state, visibility, and whether client-side filters are discarding valid data.

## Failure Handling

- If MCP is unreachable, say so and fall back only to safe filesystem inspection or code edits. Do not claim scene, prefab, or runtime verification without Unity readback.
- If an object lookup fails, inspect hierarchy and prefab contents instead of inventing a path.
- If multiple matching objects exist, print their paths and choose the one matching the user-visible UI or current scene.
- If a reference, package, tool, or path is missing, return one clear error and stop or skip that item. Do not loop through guessed fallback paths, create replacement objects silently, or report success after a best-effort fallback.
- If compile errors appear after a change, fix them before Play Mode validation.
- When Unity and text files disagree for serialized scene or prefab state, trust Unity readback and inspect the asset path.
