# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

## [0.6.5] - 2026-09-03

### Added
- The Claude Code project-guidance block Funplay writes into `CLAUDE.md` now tells the agent to check whether an unreachable `funplay-*` MCP server entry actually matches this project's own before treating Funplay as broken. Claude Code's connection check surfaces every registered server on the machine regardless of which project a session was opened in, so once two Funplay-enabled projects have each been configured (0.6.3's project-scope fix), a session in one project will still see the other project's entry reported as "Failed to connect" whenever that project's Editor isn't open -- correct routing does not change what a session's health check displays. Nothing about scoping changes here: this plugin still has no way to prove another project's entry is safe to delete, so the fix is putting that explanation where an agent is most likely to read it before mistaking a different project's disconnected entry for its own.
- The MCP Server window now shows a compact Project Skills notice for the currently selected supported client when its skills have not been installed or its managed files are missing, conflicting, or out of date. The notice links directly to the Project Skills window and stays hidden for unsupported clients and fully up-to-date installations.

### Changed
- `unity-ui-composition` Project Skill v1.0.3 now reproduces explicitly designed text outlines, shadows, glows, face dilation, softness, and related effects through `TextMeshProUGUI` and TMP shader material controls when TMP is the project's established text system. It uses `outlineColor` and `outlineWidth` for simple outlines, prefers approved or deliberately scoped material presets for other effects, and avoids unintentionally restyling unrelated labels through a shared `fontSharedMaterial`.

### Pull requests and issues
- Merged [PR #55](https://github.com/FunplayAI/funplay-unity-mcp/pull/55): clarified generated Claude Code guidance so an offline `funplay-*` entry belonging to another Unity project is not mistaken for this project's MCP server failing.
- No GitHub issues were closed by this release.

## [0.6.4] - 2026-08-31

### Added
- **DeepSeek Harness** is now a first-class client for both the MCP client config panel and Project Skills. Its MCP entry is written as a clearly-delimited managed block into every existing DSH profile's `cordis.patch.yml` (`~/.dsh/profiles/<profile>/`), because DSH selects its composition per launch via `--profile` and exposes no single "active" profile to target from outside; a fresh install with no profile at all seeds the default `web` one. A newly created profile's patch file holds `[]` as its placeholder body -- a complete flow sequence acting as the document root -- so that placeholder is dropped rather than appended to: leaving it in front of a block sequence produces YAML that DSH refuses to parse, and it exits rather than starting with the rest of the patch layer ignored. The block wraps one loader-patch item — `id: mcp-<key>`, `name: '@deepseek-ai/dsh-mcp-client'`, `config: {serverName, transport: streamable-http, url}` — using the same project-scoped entry key and hash-collision rules as the other clients, so tools surface as `mcp__<key>__<tool>`. Everything outside the managed span is preserved byte-for-byte on reconfigure, deleting the block by hand uninstalls cleanly, a previously recorded key's stale block is retired on rename (a managed block under the preferred name that points at this editor's current URL counts as our own write receipt, so losing the machine-local recorded name cannot make the next Configure mistake our own entry for another project's and add a hash-suffixed second block beside it), and any hand-written `dsh-mcp-client` entry reusing our `serverName` outside the block is surfaced loudly instead of silently breaking DSH (duplicate `serverName` values make it reject the later instance at load). As a skills platform ("dsh"), `SKILL.md` bundles are written to `<gitRoot>/.dsh/skills/` — DSH resolves its own project root by walking up to the nearest `.git` before scanning that rank-100 root, so in this monorepo layout writing under the Unity project folder would be silently never discovered — while the shared `AGENTS.md` managed block (which DeepSeek Harness reads natively through its agent-instructions loader) now stays up whenever Codex, OpenCode or DSH is enabled, and its wording gained the `.dsh/skills/` bullet with the previous renderings kept in the legacy-migration variant list.
- **OpenCode** is now a first-class client for both the MCP client config panel and Project Skills. Its MCP entry is written to this repository's own `.opencode/opencode.json` (`{"type":"remote","url":...,"enabled":true}` under `mcp`) rather than the global `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json`: OpenCode merges every config location it finds and discovers the project file by walking upward from the directory the session started in, so a file at the repository root is reachable from anywhere inside the repo while a global entry would be visible to *every* OpenCode session on the machine — the same cross-project leak project-scoping the Claude Code entry fixes below. Project Skills write `SKILL.md` files to `.opencode/skills/` -- OpenCode documents both spellings for its project directories (`agent(s)`, `command(s)`, `plugin(s)`, `skill(s)`), and the plural is the form its own config example and skills paths use -- and share the `AGENTS.md` managed block with Codex, since both clients read that file natively: the block is written while either platform is enabled and removed only when both are disabled.

### Changed
- `unity-ui-composition` Project Skill v1.0.2 now inspects and follows each project's prevailing `UnityEngine.UI.Text` or `TextMeshProUGUI` convention, defaults new projects to `TextMeshProUGUI`, preserves existing text component types during unrelated UI work, prohibits adding `Outline`, `Shadow`, or similar mesh effects as unrequested decoration, makes authored prefabs the default for reusable user-facing UI, and retains the bind-before-enable lifecycle guidance only for exceptional runtime-created `TMP_InputField` controls.

### Fixed
- The client config panel no longer rewrites a JSON config file whose contents its writer cannot reproduce. The whole file is re-serialized from a strict-JSON parse, so a config carrying JSONC comments — legal in OpenCode's `opencode.json` and VS Code's `mcp.json`, both of which are read with real JSONC parsers — stopped the key scan at the comment and silently dropped every key past it (providers, models, keybinds, agents) on write, behind a "configuration written" dialog. Such a file, and any file that does not parse as a JSON object, is now left untouched with an error naming the entry to add by hand. The same guard covers the unattended startup migration below, which rewrites `~/.claude.json` the same way but cannot ask: it migrates nothing rather than truncate a commented file.
- `capture_scene_view` now accepts `include_ui` (default `true`) and composites active Screen Space Overlay canvases from the current Scene or Prefab Stage while preserving an opt-out for the previous camera-only capture. Canvas render mode, camera, and plane distance are restored exactly after capture, including exceptional paths, so taking a screenshot does not dirty or mutate the UI being inspected.

### Pull requests and issues
- Merged [PR #53](https://github.com/FunplayAI/funplay-unity-mcp/pull/53): added first-class OpenCode and DeepSeek Harness configuration and Project Skills support, including the JSONC rewrite safety guard.
- Fixed and closed [Issue #54](https://github.com/FunplayAI/funplay-unity-mcp/issues/54): `capture_scene_view` now captures Canvas UI by default and supports `include_ui=false`.

## [0.6.3] - 2026-08-27

### Added
- One-Click MCP Configuration now supports Kimi. Current Kimi Code installs receive a project-local `.kimi-code/mcp.json` entry so one Unity project's tools do not appear in unrelated Kimi sessions; machines detected with only the legacy Kimi CLI data directory continue to use `~/.kimi/mcp.json`.

### Changed
- Recent Activity now turns valid JSON responses into a bounded human-readable message/details view: standard protocol fields such as `success` are hidden, object keys become blue labels, values use distinct readable and status-aware colors, arrays become numbered items, and raw braces and quotes are omitted. Compact MCP resource summaries and plain-text responses remain unchanged, while complete legacy JSON rows are upgraded when the panel renders them.
- NuGet releases now use GitHub OIDC Trusted Publishing with a short-lived credential, and the GitHub Release carries the exact `.nupkg` consumed by that workflow, removing the long-lived API key from the normal release path.

### Fixed
- The Claude Code entry the client config panel writes now goes into that project's `projects["<path>"].mcpServers` section of `~/.claude.json` instead of the file's top level. Claude Code applies the top level to every session on the machine regardless of which project it was opened in, so once two Funplay-enabled projects had both been configured, whichever project's Unity Editor happened to be running would have its tools exposed in an unrelated project's session too — indistinguishable from that project's own entry since both use the `mcp__funplay-<slug>__*` namespace. Per-project naming (0.6.0) made a *call* to the wrong editor structurally impossible, but did not stop a *session* from seeing (and using) the wrong editor's tools in the first place; project-scoping the entry does. Other clients here (Cursor, VS Code, Trae, Kiro, Codex) have no equivalent scoping concept in their config file and are unaffected. The panel also now flags any `funplay`/`funplay-*` entry still sitting at the config's top level as a leftover to remove by hand, since those predate this fix and are not deleted automatically.
- A project already configured under the old top-level scheme no longer depends on someone reopening the Funplay panel and clicking Configure again to stop leaking: on editor startup, `RootScopeServices` now calls a one-time, session-gated migration that moves *this project's own* previously-recorded Claude Code entry (and only that entry — proven by the same "did we record writing this key" check `RemoveSupersededFunplayEntries` already uses, so another project's entry or a hand-repointed one is never touched) from the top level into its `projects["<path>"]` scope. It runs once per Editor process (not every domain reload — `~/.claude.json` can be multi-megabyte) and requires no action from the developer.
- The `projects["<path>"]` key used for the fixes above was, until now, this Unity project's own directory (`Path.GetDirectoryName(Application.dataPath)`) — wrong whenever the git repository root sits *above* the Unity project folder (a monorepo layout, where the Unity project lives in a subdirectory of the git repo rather than at its root). Verified against the official `claude mcp add --scope local` CLI: run from the Unity project directory in such a layout, it writes to `projects[gitRoot]`, not `projects[unityProjectPath]`. Writing to the Unity project path therefore silently wrote to a key Claude Code never reads for that session — the config and the running server both looked correct, but the tools never appeared in a real session. `GetProjectScopeKeyPath()` now walks upward from the Unity project directory looking for a `.git` entry and uses that ancestor instead, falling back to the Unity project path only when no `.git` is found. The self-heal migration was extended to also lift an entry stuck at this now-corrected-away key (in addition to the top-level case above), so an already-affected project fixes itself on its next Editor startup with no action required.
- The automatic Claude Code migration now preserves an entry already present in the correct destination, removes matching loopback leftovers from both obsolete scopes in one pass, refuses to replace malformed or foreign destination structures, and leaves invalid JSON, non-Funplay keys, and hand-repointed non-loopback entries untouched. It writes through a same-directory temporary file only when the source content is still unchanged, then atomically replaces the original, preventing an interrupted or concurrent update from corrupting `~/.claude.json`.

### Contributors
- Thanks @dehuaichendragonplus for identifying and implementing the Claude Code project-scope fix in #52.

## [0.6.2] - 2026-08-11

### Changed
- `unity-ui-composition` Project Skill v1.0.1 is now built in and installed for every configured AI platform instead of requiring an optional selection. Existing v0.6.1 manifests that list it as optional are normalized automatically.

### Fixed
- `capture_game_view` now requests Game View repaints and waits for fresh Editor frames before reading Unity's internal RenderTexture, preventing consecutive captures from returning a previously rendered frame.

## [0.6.1] - 2026-08-11

### Added
- Added the optional `unity-ui-composition` Project Skill for responsive portrait and landscape uGUI work, with component selection guidance, safe-area and aspect-ratio patterns, prefab-preserving edits, performance rules, validation matrices, and links to official Unity documentation.

### Changed
- Project Skills v1.0.3 now preserve existing UI and GameObject prefab hierarchies by default, modifying only the required objects, components, and serialized fields unless a full rebuild is explicitly requested.
- Codex and Claude generated `SKILL.md` files now keep version and platform details in the managed marker and Metadata section so their YAML frontmatter follows the standard Skill schema.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-08-10

### Added
- Two Unity editors opened on different projects can now both serve MCP. **Existing projects are unaffected by the upgrade**: a settings file written by an earlier version keeps its port, now recorded as an explicit pin, so nothing moves and no client config has to be rewritten. New projects (and any project that clicks **Use Per-Project Port**) derive their port from the project path (`FunplayProjectIdentity`, mapped into 20000-29999 — above the crowded 8000-9000 developer-tool band and below the ephemeral ranges the OS allocates from), so projects no longer all aim at one shared default port. Derivation is a pure function of the path, so a project keeps its port across restarts and a client config entry stays valid. If the resolved port turns out to be held by something else — another project whose derived port collided, or an unrelated process — the transport (and, in broker mode, the broker) moves to a free port near it, warns, and reports the port it actually bound. The fallback is never persisted to disk (the port is re-derived on every start and a stored fallback would outlive the conflict), but it is remembered in SessionState for the rest of the editor session: after a domain reload the transport skips the long teardown-retry window for a port it already knows is foreign-owned (instead of re-paying ~10s of MCP outage per recompile) and re-binds the same fallback port first, so a client connected to it survives reloads. In broker mode a broker already healthy on a fallback port is kept rather than restarted while the requested port stays occupied, so domain-reload survival is unaffected; "port is held" decisions use a bind probe rather than a connect probe, so a port reserved without accepting connections cannot be misread as free. Out-of-range ports (0 or > 65535) release the pin instead of being stored as unbindable values.
- Client config entries are now named per project after the **project directory** (`funplay-<folder>`, for example `funplay-love-town`) — not `Application.productName`, which is often left at Unity's default or set to non-ASCII text; entry names keep only ASCII letters and digits, because a client tool name is restricted to `[a-zA-Z0-9_-]` and a CJK product name produced tools a client rejects outright (a name with nothing usable left falls back to the project hash) instead of one shared `funplay` key, so configuring a second project no longer overwrites the first project's entry — and in clients that namespace tools by server it becomes structurally impossible to send a call to the wrong editor. Note that this renames the tools a client exposes (for example `mcp__funplay__*` → `mcp__funplay-love-town__*`) the next time the configuration is written. Each project records the entry name it wrote — per client target, so renaming a product cleans up every configured client, not just the first one re-run — and a later write retires only its own previous entry, never an entry another project owns. Both the JSON and TOML cleanups keep a previous entry whose URL was hand-repointed at a non-local host, TOML section headers only match at the start of a line (a commented-out header can no longer corrupt the file), and the legacy shared `funplay` entry is deliberately left alone — any project could have written it — and is instead reported in the client config panel so it can be removed by hand. Product names are truncated to keep client tool names inside their 64-character limit. Two projects that share a product name resolve to the same entry name, so the second one configured **adds a project hash automatically** — detected by finding that name already in the config without this project having recorded writing it — instead of silently replacing the first project's entry. Projects that do not collide keep the clean name (a hash would cost 7 of the 25 characters an entry name can spare, truncating names much harder and putting a hex suffix in every tool name), and the panel says when it added one. There is no setting to configure: the collision is detected, so nothing has to be predicted.
- The MCP Server window says where the port came from (pinned, derived, or a fallback bind) and keeps the port field on the port actually in play. **Pin Current Port** pins the port shown (typing it would commit no change event), **Use Per-Project Port** releases a pin, and clearing the field releases it too. The client config panel shows the entry name and URL it will write. While a fallback bind is active, one-click configuration is blocked: persisting the occupied stable port could route calls to the process that owns it, while persisting the transient fallback would leave a dead entry after restart. The panel directs the user to choose a stable free port first.

### Changed
- The **Server Port** setting now records whether a port was actually chosen. Upgrading an existing project records its current port as a pin (nothing moves, no re-configuration needed); a project with no settings file yet starts unpinned and derives its port. Typing a port pins it for that project, and a cleared field releases the pin instead of pinning the old shared default. Because upgraded projects stay pinned, two of them still contend for one port until one clicks **Use Per-Project Port** -- the port-conflict warning and the window's port hint both name that as the fix. Anything that needs to know which port a project is on must read `MCPServerService.Port`/`ResolvedPort` — both are computed live (from the running transport and the current resolution respectively), so they cannot go stale while the server is stopped and cannot keep advertising a dead fallback port after a stop; the stored setting is only the override.
- The post-domain-reload restart no longer writes the pre-reload port back into the settings file. Port resolution is deterministic, so the restart lands on the same port on its own; writing it back would persist a derived or fallback port as an explicit pin and could revert a port the user changed while the reload was in flight.

### Fixed
- A request that is in flight when Unity unloads the scripting domain is no longer reported as a server error. Disposing the editor-thread pump (`RootScopeServices` disposes the container on `beforeAssemblyReload`, and `MCPServerService` disposes it on stop) cancels queued work, so the awaiting request observed a `TaskCanceledException` and the catch-all logged `Error handling request: A task was canceled.` on ordinary recompiles and Play Mode transitions. Cancellation is now recognised as a shutdown/reload condition: it is logged through the plugin debug logger instead of `Debug.LogError`, and the client receives the retryable backend-unavailable response (`-32001`, `retryable: true`, `reason: unity_backend_reloading`) that the broker already returns for the same condition, instead of `-32603 Internal error`. Nothing in this path is cancellable per request (`HandleRequestAsync` is called with a default token and no tool raises `OperationCanceledException`), so no genuine failure is reclassified.
- LM Studio configuration now recognises the exact preferred entry and loopback URL created by its first-time deep link as ownership evidence, so a second Configure updates that entry instead of adding a hash-suffixed duplicate. Project identity also preserves path case on Unix-like platforms so distinct case-sensitive paths do not collapse to one port, and the generated MCP curl example now uses an executable `PORT=24312` assignment.

### Contributors
- Thanks @dehuaichendragonplus for the domain-reload cancellation fix in #49 and the per-project port and client configuration work in #50.

## [0.5.4] - 2026-07-27

### Added
- Added `set_prefab_property` and `set_prefab_properties` for field-level edits on regular and variant prefab assets without opening Prefab Mode. The tools require normalized `Assets/**/*.prefab` paths, reject ambiguous hierarchy/component matches unless an explicit index is supplied, write serialized fields only, save through `PrefabUtility`, synchronously reimport, and return persisted readback. Both tools are included in the default `core` profile.
- Added parameterized built-in MCP workflows for safe prefab edits, compilation checks, Play Mode recovery, serialized-reference wiring, and playable prototypes. Required and unknown arguments are validated by `prompts/get`, and prompts can best-effort embed relevant read-only Unity resources.
- Projects can register validated workflow prompts through root-level `mcp-prompts/*.md` files without forking the package. Malformed, duplicate, oversized, or reserved definitions are skipped with a visible warning; changes are loaded after an MCP server restart or Unity domain reload.
- The MCP `initialize` response now includes concise cross-client instructions for Unity serialization, object identity, compilation/reload recovery, console inspection, and screenshot transport behavior.

### Changed
- Broker protocol bumped to v3 (no client-facing wire change). A pre-v3 broker still running after a package upgrade now fails the new health probe and is replaced in place, so the stale-session sweep below takes effect immediately on upgrade rather than only after the next natural broker restart. `EnsureRunning` also waits for the port to be released after shutting down its own recorded broker, so a same-port in-place replacement (which a protocol bump triggers) completes in a single call instead of bailing as "port in use" while the just-closed socket lingers.

### Fixed
- The keepalive broker now sweeps stale attached sessions instead of remembering them forever. A crashed or force-killed editor never sends a detach, so its session lingered in the broker's attached-session set indefinitely and defeated the fast-fail gate for client requests: new requests were queued and held up to the 300s hold deadline instead of failing fast once the only backend was gone. Sessions now carry a last-seen timestamp (refreshed on attach and every pull) and are swept after a staleness window (default = the 300s hold deadline, so a domain-reload/compile gap never evicts a live-but-reloading session; overridable via `FUNPLAY_BROKER_SESSION_STALE_MS`). The sweep skips the session whose long-poll is currently parked (provably alive) and reconciles a swept session's in-flight work exactly like an explicit detach — failing still-queued requests only when no backend remains, so a dead session swept while a healthy one is connected leaves those requests for the healthy session.
- Prefab Mode save and close responses now warn when UGUI layout, TMP auto-size, or Spine components are present because edit-time derived state may be included in the full-graph save. Field-only changes can use the new asset-level setters to avoid Prefab Stage recomputation.
- MCP Server transport labels now show an in-progress state and refresh only after the service-owned settings restart settles. Transport, port, and broker-path changes no longer race a fixed two-frame refresh or start a second competing Stop/Start sequence from the window; rapid setting changes are coalesced, and disabling the server during a pending restart no longer starts it again.

### Contributors
- Thanks @dehuaichendragonplus for the stale broker-session recovery work in #47, the prefab asset-editing proposal and implementation in #45, the parameterized prompt architecture in #46, and the transport status refresh fix in #48.

## [0.5.3] - 2026-07-18

### Added
- Added additive scene lifecycle tools: `load_scene_additive`, `unload_scene`, `list_dirty_scenes`, and `save_all_scenes`. They validate project scene paths, avoid duplicate loads and save dialogs, protect dirty/last-loaded scenes, require explicit confirmation before saving multiple dirty scenes, reject ambiguous scene names, and return post-operation scene state.
- `execute_code` now returns structured CS0104/CS0433 ambiguity details. CS0104 calls can pass ordered `preferred_namespaces` to apply a type alias and retry once, with the original diagnostic line mapping preserved.
- Added bounded multi-target editing to `set_transform`, `set_active`, `set_component_property`, and `set_component_properties`. Batch selectors can resolve comma-separated identifiers or one find spec and return per-target results.

### Changed
- `get_scene_info`, `list_scenes`, `enter_play_mode`, and `exit_play_mode` now return structured state. Play Mode responses report domain-reload expectations from the project's actual Enter Play Mode options.
- All mutating batch tools, including component paste/add operations, now share the same target resolver and reject more than 100 targets before making changes.

### Fixed
- Camera inspection, domain-reload recovery, and simulated mouse clicks now return structured data. Click simulation reports the actual UI receiver, avoids duplicate Button invocation and UI-to-physics click-through, and safely handles callbacks that destroy their target.
- Scene lifecycle tools now compile on Unity 6.5 and expose the editor's strongly typed scene handles as stable numeric values in tool responses.
- Auto-detected purely numeric GameObject targets now try instance ID first and fall back to an exact object-name lookup, so objects named `2048`, `512`, and similar values remain reachable without weakening explicit `find_method=by_id` calls.
- Component property writes now return authoritative post-write values for serialized and reflection-backed members, including per-target `newValue`/`applied` data in batch responses. Mutating tools also reject conflicting target selectors, malformed boolean values, and empty property maps without modifying scene objects.
- Profiler sessions now start every persistent `ProfilerRecorder` instead of leaving them idle. Editor rendering counters use current Game View `UnityStats` values rather than misleading recorder zeroes, while unsupported, stopped, and warming-up states are reported explicitly; Unity 6.4+ marks only the removed Batches statistic unavailable.

### Contributors
- Thanks @dehuaichendragonplus for trustworthy Editor profiler counter reporting in #37, numeric target routing in #38, structured tool responses in #39, type-ambiguity diagnostics in #40, additive scene lifecycle work in #41, and multi-target editing and component write-back work in #42.

## [0.5.2] - 2026-07-16

### Fixed
- Restored compilation on Unity 6.5+ by routing the remaining Mesh and Prefab object IDs and broken-reference scans through Unity's 64-bit `EntityId` APIs. The compatibility boundary now correctly starts at Unity 6.4; Unity 2022.3 and Unity 6.3 continue to use the legacy APIs. (#43, #44)

### Contributors
- Thanks @JOY for the EntityId compatibility fix in #43.

## [0.5.1] - 2026-07-12

### Added
- The MCP Server window's **Tool Exposure** row now includes a settings button that opens the full Tool Exposure window with the active `core` or `full` profile pre-selected.
- `get_test_job` now reports `possiblyStuck`, the stalled phase, inactivity duration, and current test when Test Runner callbacks stop. Runner startup uses a 30-second threshold while a known running test gets 120 seconds to avoid premature warnings for normal long tests.
- `execute_code` gained a `skip_refresh` option that bypasses the pre-compile `AssetDatabase.Refresh` + wait-for-ready. Use it for read-only inspection snippets or during a live Play Mode session you must not disturb: the default refresh can trigger an import/domain reload (from your own or another actor's pending changes in a shared editor) that wipes Play Mode runtime state. When skipped, external file edits since the last compile are not picked up.
- Screenshot captures now auto-fall back to a file when the payload would exceed a safe transport size, instead of emitting an oversized base64 payload that reliably drops the client socket. The threshold is measured on the raw PNG (512 KB) so the ~1.33x base64 expansion still lands under the drop point; `capture_multiview`'s default (inline) path is covered too -- it spills all frames to files when their combined size is too large. The response carries the same `{ path, bytes, fell_back_to_file: true }` shape as an explicit `save_to_file`. Small captures are still returned inline; `save_to_file` remains an explicit override.
- Added dedicated capability tools for asset import settings, dependency/broken-reference inspection, mesh and material inspection, 2D/3D physics queries, particle preview control, project settings, Undo/Redo, component batch operations, lighting, and reflection-based PlayableDirector evaluation. Reverse dependency scans are bounded and yield between batches; mutating setters validate the whole request before writing.

### Changed
- Project Skills now manage only a delimited Funplay block inside shared `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md` files, preserving all hand-authored content outside it. Exact legacy generated files migrate automatically; edited legacy single-marker files are left unchanged with an explicit migration error instead of being overwritten.

### Fixed
- Built-in tools that accept a GameObject target now consistently resolve names, hierarchy paths, and instance IDs through `ObjectsHelper`, including inactive objects and additively loaded scenes. `get_console_logs` also supports an opt-in `include_stack_trace` argument with independently capped, normalized stack output.
- `MCPBrokerTransportTests` (8 of the package's 61 EditMode tests) hardcoded the broker source path as `Assets/unity-mcp/Editor/MCP/Server/Broker/keepalive-broker.cs.txt`, which only exists when this repo's own source is checked out directly under `Assets/` -- it always failed in any project that installs the package properly (embedded, git, or registry), since there the source lives under `Packages/<name>` or `Library/PackageCache/<name>@version`. Both the filesystem lookup (`ResolveBrokerSourcePath`, used by 7 tests via `CreateBrokerPaths`) and the `AssetDatabase` lookup (`BrokerSource_IsVisibleToAssetDatabaseForUnityPackageExport`) now resolve through `PackageInfo.FindForAssembly` first and only fall back to the old `Assets/unity-mcp` path when the assembly isn't part of a package (preserving this repo's own dev-checkout layout).
- Tool argument parsing no longer silently coerces a malformed value to `default(T)` / `Vector3.zero` and runs with it. A missing required value now returns `MISSING_PARAM`; a value that cannot be parsed into its parameter type (a non-numeric int, a two-component `'x,y'` passed where an `'x,y,z'` vector is expected, an out-of-range enum, etc.) returns `INVALID_PARAM` with the parameter name, provided value, and expected format. This applies to reflected and manually registered tools, and `set_transform` / `create_primitive` validate vectors before modifying the scene.
- Several `Profiler`/memory tools returned error/precondition conditions (`get_object_memory` with an empty target, `memory_list_snapshots` with no snapshots, `get_frame_timing` with no timing available, `frame_debugger_get_events` with no events) as bare human-readable strings on the success channel, so callers -- and the plugin's own `IsError()` check -- treated the failure as success. They now return structured `{ success: false, code }` errors.
- Every tool response is now uniformly parseable as `{ success, ... }`. Legacy tools that returned a bare human-readable string on success (while only errors were structured JSON) are wrapped in `{ success: true, message }` by the result serializer. Image data URIs and strings that are already a `{ success: ... }` envelope pass through untouched, so screenshots still render as images and error envelopes are never double-wrapped.

### Contributors
- Thanks @dehuaichendragonplus for the fixes and feature proposals behind this release (#30, #31, #32, #33, #34, #35, #36).

## [0.5.0] - 2026-07-07

### Added
- Project Skills now include explicit bundled skill versions in generated `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, Cursor rules, and the Funplay skill manifest, so users can tell when installed project guidance is stale.
- The Project Skills window now shows installed skill file status and exposes an `Upgrade Skills` action when Funplay-managed guidance files are behind the package version.
- `save_to_file` option on all screenshot tools (`capture_game_view`, `capture_scene_view`, `capture_simulator_view`, `capture_multiview`): writes the PNG to disk (default `Library/FunplayMcp/Screenshots/`, or a custom `output_path` that resolves inside the Unity project root) and returns the file path instead of base64 image data. High-resolution captures previously produced multi-megabyte base64 payloads that could break MCP transports; saving to a file and letting the client read it sidesteps the payload entirely.
- New `capture_editor_window` tool: screenshot any open EditorWindow (Inspector, Console, custom tool windows...) by title or type name. Captures directly from the window's internal GUIView render surface, so the window does not need to be unoccluded on screen.
- New `raycast_at_point` UI diagnostic tool: runs the live EventSystem's RaycastAll at a screen point and reports the full ordered hit chain (hierarchy path, raycast-receiving Graphic, raycastTarget flag, sorting info) plus the `IPointerClickHandler` that would actually receive a click there -- or the element silently swallowing the click when the topmost hit has no handler anywhere up its parent chain (the classic invisible-raycast-blocker bug). Coordinates can be pixels or normalized, with bottom-left or top-left origin; sizes are resolved against the real Game View render resolution rather than the editor window.
- Real Unity memory snapshot (.snap) tools -- the full-detail captures the Memory Profiler package opens for object-level reference-chain analysis, complementing the existing lightweight aggregate-counter snapshots (`memory_take_snapshot`): `memory_take_full_snapshot` captures via `Unity.Profiling.Memory.MemoryProfiler.TakeSnapshot` (configurable CaptureFlags, async completion, written into the Memory Profiler package's snapshot folder), `memory_list_full_snapshots` lists them, and `memory_open_snapshot_in_profiler` loads one into the Memory Profiler window (com.unity.memoryprofiler package required for that last step only; capture itself is a core-engine API). Combine with `capture_editor_window('Memory Profiler')` to inspect the loaded analysis visually.
- Two headless structured-query tools for those same .snap files -- no window, no screenshot: `memory_query_top_objects` ranks native objects (Texture2D, Mesh, RenderTexture, etc.) by size with an optional type-name filter, and `memory_query_references` returns what references a given object or what it references (`referenced_by`/`references_to`), resolving the target by name or by the index `memory_query_top_objects` returned. Both load the snapshot via `SnapshotDataService.LoadWithoutLoadingToUI` (the package's crawler, without opening any UI) and reflect into the crawled `CachedSnapshot`'s native object table and connection graph.

### Changed
- Updated README tool inventory and install snippets for the expanded 128-tool surface.

### Contributors
- Thanks @dehuaichendragonplus for the screenshot/UI diagnostics and real memory snapshot PRs (#28, #29).

## [0.4.9] - 2026-07-03

### Added
- Added 13 Profiler tools (category `Profiler`): `profiler_start`/`profiler_stop`/`profiler_status` for session control; `get_frame_timing`/`get_counters` for CPU/GPU frame timing and persistent `ProfilerRecorder` counters; `get_object_memory` for per-asset/GameObject runtime memory footprint; `get_top_memory_objects` for ranking ALL loaded objects of a type by memory (the "which objects are consuming it" follow-up to a snapshot diff); `memory_take_snapshot`/`memory_list_snapshots`/`memory_compare_snapshots` for lightweight aggregate memory snapshots (not real `.snap` files); `frame_debugger_enable`/`frame_debugger_disable`/`frame_debugger_get_events` for driving the Frame Debugger via reflection. See [PROFILER_TOOLS.md](PROFILER_TOOLS.md) for the full reference, implementation notes, known limitations, and test report.
- Added prefab stage editing tools: `open_prefab_stage` opens a prefab asset in Prefab Mode for isolated editing (hierarchy/component tools and `execute_code` then operate on the prefab contents), `save_prefab_stage` persists edits back to the `.prefab` asset without closing, and `close_prefab_stage` returns to the main stage with an explicit save/discard choice. Closing clears the stage's dirty flag first so a blocking "save changes?" modal can never stall the MCP request.
- `get_console_logs` gained two optional parameters: `group_duplicates` collapses repeated identical messages into one "message (xN)" line (in a real project this compacted 100 cached entries down to 20 unique lines, keeping spammy Animator warnings from drowning out unique entries), and `filter_text` filters entries by a case-insensitive substring. Both apply to the cache and console read paths; default behavior is unchanged.
- Added ScriptableObject asset tools: `create_scriptable_object` creates a new asset of any ScriptableObject-derived type, `get_scriptable_object` reads all serialized properties (including `[SerializeField]` private fields), and `set_scriptable_object_properties` writes fields with a per-field success report and persists via `SaveAssetIfDirty`. Reuses the component property machinery (`ComponentSerializer` signatures widened from `Component` to `UnityEngine.Object`, source-compatible for existing callers).
- Added Animator runtime control tools: `get_animator_state` reads the current state (state name resolved from the controller when possible, including through AnimatorOverrideController) plus all parameters with current values; `set_animator_parameter` sets a parameter by name with automatic Float/Int/Bool/Trigger type detection; `play_animator_state` plays a named state and force-evaluates the animator once in Edit Mode so poses apply without entering Play Mode (useful for driving UI to a known state before a screenshot).
- Added Unity Test Runner integration with an async job pattern: `run_tests` starts an EditMode/PlayMode run (with optional test/category/assembly filters) and returns a job id immediately; `get_test_job` polls progress (completed/total) and final results (pass/fail/skip counts plus failure messages and truncated stack traces); `cancel_test_run` cancels a stuck run (requires com.unity.test-framework 1.3+, resolved by reflection and reported as unsupported on the 1.1.x that Unity 2022.3 bundles). Job state lives in SessionState and the results callback re-registers on every domain load, so PlayMode runs that reload the domain mid-run still report completion.
- Declared `capabilities.tools.listChanged` in the `initialize` response and implemented lazy `notifications/tools/list_changed` delivery: when the exposed tool set changes (Tool Exposure save, newly registered tools after a recompile), the next client request that accepts `text/event-stream` receives an SSE response carrying the notification before the JSON-RPC result, so MCP clients such as Claude Code refresh their tool list without a session restart. Supported on both the direct HTTP transport and broker mode (broker protocol v2 with Accept/Content-Type passthrough).

### Changed
- MCP Server panel UX improvements to the transport/broker controls:
  - The transport selector is now a "Transport Mode" dropdown (`Direct HTTP (default)` / `Broker Mode (Experimental)`) instead of a checkbox, so the two transports read as an explicit mutually-exclusive choice instead of an on/off flag.
  - The "Broker Mono Path" field now shows the real effect of the "leave empty to auto-detect" default instead of always rendering blank: when no override is set, the field displays the actually auto-detected Mono executable path (display-only — it does not persist as an override), and if auto-detection fails, the field stays empty and a red inline hint explains that broker mode needs the path set manually.

  Behavior, defaults, and the underlying settings are unchanged — both are presentation-only improvements.

### Fixed
- Broker manager now gracefully shuts down a stale broker process that no longer passes the health probe (typically a protocol-version mismatch after a package upgrade) instead of leaving it holding the port and failing the server with "Address already in use".
- A failure while handling a single broker-delivered request no longer terminates the broker poll loop (which previously left all subsequent requests queued forever).
- Fixed a broker process leak when the Server Port setting changes while broker mode is active: `MCPBrokerProcessManager.EnsureRunning` only shut down the previously recorded broker process when its recorded port matched the newly requested port, so changing the port left the old broker orphaned (and deleted its pid file, making it unrecoverable by any later cleanup) while a fresh broker started on the new port. The stale-broker shutdown now runs regardless of whether the port changed.
- The "Server Port" field now commits on Enter/blur rather than per keystroke, so the settings-change restart path runs once per committed value instead of once per typed digit. The restart scheduler also uses editor-update fallbacks alongside `delayCall` for both stop and start phases, so port changes made from tools or non-IMGUI callbacks cannot get stuck with a scheduled-but-never-run restart.
- Fixed `get_performance_snapshot` and `analyze_scene_complexity` under-reporting scene stats in multi-scene projects. Both tools sourced root GameObjects from `SceneManager.GetActiveScene()` only, silently excluding any additively loaded scenes (e.g. a bootstrap scene loading a content scene on top); they now walk every loaded scene via `SceneManager.sceneCount`/`GetSceneAt`, and the "Scene:" summary line is renamed "Scene(s):" to list every scene that was counted.
- Fixed `get_hierarchy` and `get_scene_info` silently omitting additively loaded scenes: both sourced content from `SceneManager.GetActiveScene()` only, so in multi-scene projects (e.g. a bootstrap scene additively loading a content scene) everything outside the active scene was invisible. Both tools now walk every loaded scene, label each as `(active)`/`(additive)`, and `get_hierarchy`'s `root_name` inactive-object search fallback also spans all loaded scenes.
- `get_console_logs` now truncates each emitted line to 300 characters (annotated with the remaining length). A single log entry containing a huge one-line payload (observed in the wild: an entire 280KB save-file JSON logged to the console) previously blew up the whole tool response.

### Contributors
- Thanks @dehuaichendragonplus for the feature and fix PRs behind this release (#17, #18, #19, #20, #21, #22, #23, #24, #25, #27).

## [0.4.8] - 2026-06-24

### Fixed
- Fixed vertically flipped Game View screenshots when reading Unity's already-rendered PlayModeView frame.
- Kept camera-rendered screenshots such as Scene View and fallback Game View captures in their native orientation.

## [0.4.7] - 2026-06-23

### Added
- Added a recommended `IFunplayCommand` template to generated project skills, including traceable `ctx.Log` usage and Undo-aware object modification helpers.
- Added generated skill guidance for Unity fake-null references: avoid `??=` when lazily resolving `UnityEngine.Object` references and use explicit `if (field == null)` checks instead.
- Added a GitHub Actions workflow for publishing the MCP Registry entry with GitHub OIDC after the NuGet package is indexed.

### Changed
- `execute_code` now automatically adds `using Funplay.Editor.Tools.Scripting;` when a full-class snippet implements an unqualified `IFunplayCommand`, while avoiding duplicate usings when the namespace is already present.

### Fixed
- Fixed the release helper's Unity EditMode test invocation so batchmode waits for Test Runner completion and writes the XML result instead of exiting immediately after import.
- Release unitypackage validation now also rejects `.github` paths so publishing automation files cannot leak into package exports.

## [0.4.6] - 2026-06-17

### Fixed
- Made external script refresh and compilation requests resilient when Unity Auto Refresh is disabled or a hot-reload plugin intercepts the normal refresh path. `request_recompile`, `wait_for_compilation(force_refresh)`, and `execute_code` now share a fallback refresh flow and return `REFRESH_DID_NOT_START_COMPILATION` instead of reporting stale compilation results as success when scripts still look uncompiled. (#15)

## [0.4.5] - 2026-06-17

### Added
- Added `capture_simulator_view` to capture Unity's Device Simulator screen, optionally select the Simulator device by name, and draw a Safe Area outline overlay while preserving the source aspect ratio when only one output dimension is provided.

### Fixed
- Fixed Device Simulator captures being vertically flipped.
- Removed the Game View fallback from Device Simulator captures so device switches no longer return a stale 16:9 Game View image when the Simulator preview texture is not ready.

## [0.4.4] - 2026-06-15

### Added
- Added an optional experimental Broker Mode for the MCP Server. When enabled, a tiny local broker process owns the HTTP port and keeps client requests alive while Unity reloads the scripting domain; direct in-process HTTP remains the default.
- Broker Mode now returns a retryable JSON-RPC error for new requests while the Unity backend is reloading or reconnecting, instead of letting short client timeouts expire silently.

### Fixed
- Improved `execute_code` unexpected failure diagnostics by unwrapping `TargetInvocationException` and returning the underlying exception type, message, and stack trace. (#14)

## [0.4.3] - 2026-06-06

### Changed
- Documented OpenUPM as an optional UPM registry install source for users who want Unity Package Manager to show registry-backed version history.
- Added optional release-script verification for OpenUPM indexing after new tags are published.

### Fixed
- Fixed `capture_game_view` returning black frames in URP/HDRP projects by reading the rendered Game View frame before falling back to `camera.Render()`. (#11, #12)

### Contributors
- Thanks @dehuaichendragonplus for the detailed URP/HDRP Game View capture report and patch.

## [0.4.2] - 2026-06-06

### Changed
- `execute_code` now compiles snippets through Unity's bundled Roslyn csc first while preserving the in-memory compilation/execution flow. This improves support for modern C# syntax such as target-typed `new()` and switch expressions without writing snippet files into the Unity project.
- Release packaging now explicitly rejects local IDE metadata and macOS `.DS_Store` files in addition to tests, local notes, token files, and host-project folders.

## [0.4.1] - 2026-06-03

### Changed
- Narrowed optional `execute_code` project namespace auto-injection to loaded assemblies under `Library/ScriptAssemblies`, reducing wrapper size and type-name ambiguity when the opt-in setting is enabled.

### Fixed
- Downgraded expected response-write failures after client disconnects or domain reloads so `socket has been shut down` no longer appears as a Unity Console error.
- Marked non-resumed tools interrupted by script recompilation as `Interrupted` in Recent Activity instead of showing a misleading green `OK`.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-06-02

### Changed
- `execute_code` no longer auto-injects project namespaces by default. The optional MCP Settings toggle now derives namespaces from loaded project assemblies instead of regex-scanning source files, avoiding source-only, conditional, or asmdef-isolated namespaces that can make every snippet fail with `COMPILATION_FAILED`. (#9)
- Moved `execute_code` safety controls out of the MCP Server window and into **Funplay > MCP Settings** alongside debug logging.

## [0.3.9] - 2026-06-01

### Added
- Added stricter default-on filesystem safety checks for `execute_code`, covering broad `System.IO` writes, raw file streams, absolute/user/system paths, and path traversal patterns while clearly documenting that this is not a full sandbox.
- Added a local release helper script for version bumping, Unity test/export flows, unitypackage pathname validation, release notes, checksums, and optional publishing.

### Changed
- Split the MCP Server window into smaller focused panels and moved related settings, tool exposure, project skills, and skills management classes out of the monolithic window file.
- Standardized tool error results on structured JSON envelopes with `success:false`, `code`, `error`, and optional `data`; legacy `Error:` text is no longer treated as an error signal.
- Disabled verbose plugin debug logging by default and kept high-volume request logs in the Recent Activity UI instead of the Unity Console.

### Fixed
- Filtered release unitypackages through an explicit asset list so local-only files, tests, ProjectSettings, Packages, Library, and token files cannot be included accidentally.
- Hardened release-script cleanup, non-publishing flows, and Unity export handling so a lingering batchmode process does not block package validation after a package has already been written.

## [0.3.8] - 2026-05-23

### Added
- Added a default-on `execute_code` safety checks toggle to the MCP Server window. Clients that omit the `safety_checks` argument now use this project-level default, while explicit tool arguments still override it.

### Fixed
- Reworked the MCP HTTP transport to use a directly owned loopback TCP listener and retry post-domain-reload binds, avoiding Windows/Unity 6 `Address already in use` recovery failures caused by stale listener state.
- Avoided Unity synchronization-context capture during transport bind retries so occupied-port recovery cannot stall the editor when callers synchronously wait on startup.
- Hardened editor-thread queued task cleanup during server disposal so pending work is cancelled cleanly across domain reloads.

## [0.3.7] - 2026-05-22

### Fixed
- Added a project-path-hash identity to MCP `initialize` responses so an existing Funplay listener can be verified as belonging to the same Unity project without exposing the raw local path.
- When HTTP binding finds the configured port already occupied, the transport now probes `initialize` and attaches only if both the Funplay server name and project identity match.
- Attached transports detach without closing the owning listener, while owned transports still stop and close their `HttpListener` normally.
- Probe timeouts and unrelated listeners are treated as probe failures, not as external cancellation.
- The MCP Server window now distinguishes an attached existing server from a listener owned by the current service.

## [0.3.6] - 2026-05-21

### Fixed
- Made MCP server start idempotent across concurrent window, settings, and domain-reload startup paths so repeated Start calls reuse the same in-flight startup instead of creating competing HTTP transports.
- Hardened HTTP transport cleanup during Unity reloads and Stop/Dispose races, including already-disposed `HttpListener` instances.
- Recognize Windows and Mono `HttpListener` address-in-use variants (`10048`, `183`, `Only one usage...`, and `another listener...`) during restart retry detection.
- Clean up partially initialized server transport, request handler, and resource provider state after failed or cancelled starts.

## [0.3.5] - 2026-05-21

### Fixed
- Updated LM Studio one-click configuration to use the official `lmstudio://add_mcp` flow and avoid creating guessed Windows `mcp.json` paths. Existing LM Studio config files are still updated when found.

## [0.3.4] - 2026-05-20

### Added
- Added LM Studio to the MCP Server window's one-click configuration targets. The generated config writes `funplay` to LM Studio's `mcp.json` using Cursor-compatible `mcpServers` JSON.
- Documented manual LM Studio setup paths for macOS/Linux and Windows.

## [0.3.3] - 2026-05-20

### Fixed
- Unitypackage-based updates now filter downloaded release packages before import and only allow paths under the installed `Assets/unity-mcp` root. This prevents accidental release artifacts from overwriting host-project `ProjectSettings`, `Packages`, or `Library` files during one-click updates.

## [0.3.2] - 2026-05-18

### Added
- `Funplay > MCP Server` window now shows the installed package version, polls GitHub for new releases every 6 hours, and surfaces a one-click update prompt when a newer version is available. Auto-check is skipped in Unity batch mode.

### Fixed
- Post-domain-reload server restart is now resilient to (a) the `[InitializeOnLoad]` vs `afterAssemblyReload` ordering race — the handler also kicks off a restart from its own static ctor if reload bookkeeping is pending, (b) `EditorApplication.isCompiling` still being true when the `delayCall` fires, (c) the service provider not yet being available, (d) duplicate scheduling. The restart now retries via `EditorApplication.update` until the editor is settled.
- `HttpMCPTransport.StartAsync` now retries up to 10 seconds (40 × 250 ms) when the port is briefly held by an unwinding listener after an AppDomain transition. Eliminates residual `Address already in use` failures that 0.3.1 did not fully cover for fast-reload scenarios.
- `DomainReloadHandler.CompletePendingFunction` defers the pending-function clear when the editor is mid-compile / mid-update / about to change Play Mode, instead of clearing immediately and racing the reload. 15-second fallback timeout prevents indefinite deferral.
- Root services and MCP server startup are now no-ops in Unity batch mode (`-batchmode`), so running batch jobs in parallel with a foreground Editor that already binds port 8765 no longer conflicts.
- `request_recompile` now returns a clear error when called while Unity is in Play Mode (Unity does not process script compilation or domain reloads while playing). Call `exit_play_mode` first, then retry.

### Changed
- `unity-mcp-workflow` skill (and the generated `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md` templates) now document two Play Mode lifecycle pitfalls: (1) after `enter_play_mode`, the HTTP server is briefly unreachable while Unity reloads the domain — poll `tools/list` / `get_reload_recovery_status` until it responds before issuing the next call; (2) `request_recompile` is rejected during Play Mode and must be preceded by `exit_play_mode`. Existing installs should regenerate Project Skills via `Funplay > Project Skills` to pick up the new content.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-05-17

### Fixed
- Compile errors on Unity 6000.4+ where `Object.GetInstanceID()` and `EditorUtility.InstanceIDToObject(int)` are deprecated ahead of becoming obsolete-as-error in Unity 6000.5. Object IDs handed to MCP clients now go through a new internal `ObjectIdHelper` that uses `GetEntityId` / `EditorUtility.EntityIdToObject` on Unity 6000.4+ and the legacy `InstanceID` API on older Unity. (#3)
- HTTP transport could fail to restart after a Unity domain reload with `通常每个套接字地址(协议/网络地址/端口)只允许使用一次。` / `Address already in use`. Root cause was a fire-and-forget `StopAsync` in `beforeAssemblyReload` — Unity unloaded the AppDomain before the listener actually released the port. `MCPServerService` now exposes a synchronous `StopSync` used by both `Dispose` and the domain-reload handler, and `RootScopeServices.Initialize` skips its auto-start during a post-reload restart so only one start path runs. (#1)

### Changed (potentially breaking for downstream clients)
- `instanceId`, `componentInstanceId`, and `fileID` fields in tool responses are now always JSON strings instead of numbers. On Unity 6000.4+ they are `EntityId` text; on older Unity they are decimal `InstanceID` strings. Clients that parsed these fields as integers must accept strings.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-05-06

### Added
- New foundation helpers under `Editor/Tools/Helpers/`: `ObjectsHelper` (unified by_id/by_name/by_path/by_tag/by_layer/by_component locator with searchInactive / searchInChildren / findAll, prefab-stage aware), `ComponentSerializer` (SerializedObject-based read/write that picks up `[SerializeField] private`, Object references via `{"fileID": instanceId}`, Vector/Quaternion/Color/Enum/Array), `TypeResolver` (TypeCache-backed O(1) component type lookup), `Response` (structured `{success, message, data}` / `{success, code, error, data}` envelope), `EditorReadyHelper` (refresh + wait for compilation), `GameObjectSerializer` (structured payloads with `instanceId` so agents can chain `by_id` calls).
- New `EditorState` tool provider: `get_editor_state`, `get_selection`, `set_selection`, `get_prefab_stage`, `get_active_tool`, `set_active_tool`, `get_windows`, `get_tags`, `add_tag`, `remove_tag`, `get_layers`, `add_layer`, `get_build_settings`.
- New `MenuItem` tool provider: `execute_menu_item`, `validate_menu_item` — drive any editor menu including third-party packages without writing dedicated wrappers.
- New `IFunplayCommand` + `ExecutionContext` API for `execute_code`. Snippets that implement `IFunplayCommand` get `ctx.RegisterObjectCreation` / `RegisterObjectModification` / `DestroyObject` (auto-Undo + tracked) and `ctx.Log` / `LogWarning` / `LogError` (returned in the response).
- `ComponentPropertyFunctions`: new `component_instance_id` parameter lets tools target a specific component when a GameObject has multiple of the same type.

### Changed
- All `GameObject` tools now resolve targets through `ObjectsHelper` and accept a new `find_method` parameter (defaults to auto-detect: id → path → name).
- `GameObject` and `ComponentProperty` tools now return structured JSON (`Response.Success(...)`) instead of free-form strings, with `instanceId` included so agents can chain `by_id` lookups reliably.
- `ComponentPropertyFunctions.SetComponentProperty(ies)` now writes through `SerializedObject`, so `[SerializeField] private` fields and Object references work; partial writes return per-field success.
- `execute_code` now calls `EditorReadyHelper.RefreshAndWaitForReady` before compiling, so external file edits are picked up automatically — no separate `request_recompile` needed in most flows.
- `FunctionInvokerController` now serializes non-string tool returns to JSON via Newtonsoft, so tools can return `Response.Success(...)` or any object.
- `unity-mcp-workflow` project skill rules updated to cover structured JSON returns, `instanceId` chaining, `find_method`, the new SerializedProperty-backed component setter, the IFunplayCommand template, editor-state tools, and `execute_menu_item` as the preferred fallback before `execute_code`. Generated `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md` templates updated to match. Existing installed skills must be regenerated via `Funplay > Project Skills` to pick up the new content.
- `core` profile expanded from 19 to 29 tools: added `get_editor_state`, `get_selection`, `set_selection`, `get_prefab_stage`, `find_game_objects`, `list_components`, `get_component_properties`, `set_component_property`, `set_component_properties`, `execute_menu_item`. Lower-frequency editor-state tools (tag/layer mutation, window listing, build settings, active-tool control, `validate_menu_item`) remain `full`-only.

### Breaking
- `GameObjectFunctions` parameter renames for clarity now that resolution is method-driven: `name` → `target` (delete/duplicate/rename/set_transform/set_active/add_component/set_tag_and_layer/get_game_object_info), `parent_name` → `parent`, `child_name` → `child`. The new `find_method` parameter is optional everywhere.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-04-30

### Changed
- Limited Project Skills to the verified default `unity-mcp-workflow` skill and removed unverified optional skills from the catalog.
- Moved Codex project skill installation from `.agents/skills/` to project-root `.codex/skills/`.
- Moved Claude project skill installation from `.claude/commands/` to project-root `.claude/skills/`.
- Renamed Project Skills to use the final feature name across UI and docs.
- Added a one-click `Configure + Skills` action for supported MCP clients.
- Added `Funplay > Tool Exposure` for editing which tools `core` and `full` expose.
- Grouped the Tool Exposure editor by tool category with per-category selection controls.
- Updated the default Unity MCP workflow skill to cover default `core`, default `full`, and customized tool exposure.
- Rendered screenshot tool results as image previews in Recent Activity.
- Added `Funplay > Plugin Settings` with a toggle for verbose plugin debug logging.
- Enabled plugin debug logging by default and expanded the default Unity MCP workflow skill with safer scene, prefab, and readback validation guidance.

## [0.1.10] - 2026-04-17

### Added
- Added `Funplay > Project Skills` as a dedicated window for project-level skills setup

### Changed
- Strengthened `request_recompile` tool guidance so AI clients treat it as the default follow-up after external file edits
- Improved `request_recompile` behavior to return an explicit compilation/reload message instead of failing ambiguously during domain reload
- Persist and report recovery results for external sync operations through `get_reload_recovery_status`

## [0.1.5] - 2026-04-01

### Added

- Tools exposed by the open-source build now execute directly without an extra approval toggle
- Play Mode MCP requests no longer stall on the editor thread dispatch path
- MCP server info now reports the package version dynamically instead of a hard-coded version
