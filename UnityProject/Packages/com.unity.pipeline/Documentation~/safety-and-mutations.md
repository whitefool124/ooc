# Safety & mutations

Mutating commands — asset writes, project-settings changes, package/build changes —
share two conventions so command authors and clients know what to expect: a `confirm`/`dry_run` gate
on destructive or overwriting operations, and Undo grouping via `AuthoringUndoScope`. Commands that
resolve caller-supplied asset paths confine them with `ProjectPaths` (see
[Creating authoring commands](authoring-commands.md)). The helpers live in `Editor/Authoring/`.

### The confirm / dry_run convention

Destructive or overwriting commands expose two boolean `[CliArg]`s — `confirm` and `dry_run` — and
gate their own mutation on them. There is no central dispatcher; each command applies the same simple
rules inline:

- **`dry_run == true`** → validate and describe the intended change, mutate nothing, return a preview.
  This wins even if `confirm` is also true.
- **`confirm == false`** (and not a dry run) → refuse without mutating. Return the failure the way the
  command reports its other errors — `throw new ArgumentException(...)` for the throwing style (e.g.
  `delete_asset`, `clear_baked_lighting`), or a structured error object for commands that return
  structured results (e.g. `build`, which returns `{ success = false, status = "error", message = "…" }`).
- **otherwise** (`confirm == true`, not a dry run) → perform the mutation. Group *scene/object*
  mutations in an `AuthoringUndoScope` (see below). Asset/settings/package writes are **not** part of
  Unity's Undo, so they run directly — say so in the command description ("Not undoable via Ctrl+Z.").

```csharp
[CliCommand("clear_baked_lighting", "Clear baked lightmap data for the open scene(s). Destructive: requires confirm=true (use dry_run to preview). Not undoable via Ctrl+Z.")]
public static object ClearBakedLighting(
    [CliArg("confirm", "Apply the clear. Without it the call is refused.")] bool confirm = false,
    [CliArg("dry_run", "Preview what would be cleared without clearing it.")] bool dryRun = false)
{
    // …resolve the open scene(s)…
    if (dryRun)
        return new { status = "dry_run", wouldClear = true };
    if (!confirm)
        throw new ArgumentException("Refusing to clear baked lighting. Pass confirm=true to apply, or dry_run=true to preview.");

    // Clearing baked GI is not part of Unity's Undo — no AuthoringUndoScope.
    Lightmapping.Clear();

    return new { cleared = true };
}
```

Purely additive, non-destructive commands (e.g. `create_folder`, `add_animator_parameter`)
do not take `confirm`/`dry_run`; they just perform the mutation directly.

### Undo grouping

Scene/object mutations are grouped with `AuthoringUndoScope` so a multi-step command reverts as a
single Ctrl+Z step. It increments Unity's current Undo group on construction and calls
`Undo.CollapseUndoOperations` on dispose, collapsing everything the body registers — via
`Undo.RecordObject`, `Undo.RegisterCreatedObjectUndo`, and similar — into one named step. The command
opts into Undo by calling those APIs inside the scope. See
[Creating authoring commands](authoring-commands.md) for the full pattern and the per-mutation `Undo`
API table.

> **Caveat.** Some operations are not part of Unity's Undo system. `AssetDatabase` operations, UPM
> package changes, and settings backed by native assets may not be undoable; for those the collapse is
> simply a no-op and Ctrl+Z will not revert the change. Don't rely on Undo to clean up such writes —
> validate up front and fail before writing.

### Path confinement

Commands that accept a caller-supplied asset path resolve it through `ProjectPaths.Resolve`, which
normalizes the path, rejects `..` traversal, and confines it to the configurable authoring root
(default `Assets`) so agent-supplied paths cannot escape the project. It returns a project-relative
path, or `null` with an `error` string when the path escapes the root.

```csharp
var normalized = ProjectPaths.Resolve(path, out var error);
if (normalized == null)
    throw new ArgumentException(error);
// normalized is project-relative and guaranteed to live under the authoring root.
```

See [Creating authoring commands](authoring-commands.md) for the full path-handling rules and the
`set_authoring_root` / `get_authoring_root` commands that adjust the root.

### For command authors

To make a mutating command safe:

1. If the operation is destructive or overwrites existing content, add `confirm` and `dry_run` boolean
   `[CliArg]`s and gate on them inline (preview on `dry_run`, refuse on `!confirm`).
2. Group scene/object mutations in `using (new AuthoringUndoScope("<operation>"))` and register Undo
   operations inside it where the mutation is undoable.
3. Resolve any caller-supplied asset path through `ProjectPaths.Resolve` before touching the filesystem
   — ideally during validation, so a bad path fails before anything is applied.

See [Creating commands](creating-commands.md) and [Creating authoring commands](authoring-commands.md).
