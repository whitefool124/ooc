# Runtime connection & setup

How to run the Pipeline server inside a built Player so a client can drive it the same way it drives the Editor. The runtime server only exists in **development builds**, so setup is mostly about building correctly.

The package's runtime assemblies (`Unity.Pipeline`, `Unity.Pipeline.IlInterpreter`) and its bundled Roslyn DLLs carry the define constraint `UNITY_EDITOR || DEVELOPMENT_BUILD || ENABLE_RUNTIME_PIPELINE`, so Unity does not compile or package them for a non-development Player build. A release build contains no Pipeline code regardless of how `enableInBuilds` is set.

To ship the Pipeline in a build that is *not* a Development Build, add `ENABLE_RUNTIME_PIPELINE` to the scripting define symbols for that build (Project Settings → Player → Scripting Define Symbols, or `BuildPlayerOptions.extraScriptingDefines`). The build then contains the same Pipeline assemblies a development build would, and `enableInBuilds` still decides whether the server actually starts. Only do this deliberately: such a build carries a local HTTP server that executes commands.

## Configuring the runtime server

The runtime server is configured entirely through **Project Settings → Pipeline → Runtime**. No GameObject or component needs to be added to any scene — `RuntimePipelineBootstrap` creates the runtime driver automatically at boot (Player start, or entering Play Mode in the Editor) if settings exist and `enableInBuilds` is on.

Your settings are never written as a file under `Assets/` — they live in `ProjectSettings/Packages/com.unity.pipeline/RuntimePipelineConfig.json`, a normal, tracked part of `ProjectSettings/` (the same place Unity itself keeps most other project-wide settings). Merely viewing the Project Settings page, or reading via `get_runtime_pipeline_settings`, shows built-in defaults but never creates this file — it's written the first time you actually change a setting (through the page, or a confirmed `set_runtime_pipeline_settings`).

**Security warning:** whenever `enableInBuilds` is on *and* Development Build is checked, the settings page shows a persistent warning — that build really will carry the HTTP server and remote code execution. With Development Build unchecked the page instead notes that the setting has no effect, since the Pipeline assemblies are excluded from that build.

### Settings

| Field | Default | Meaning |
|-------|---------|---------|
| `enableInBuilds` | `false` | Master switch. The server only starts when this is `true`. **Off by default for safety.** |
| `autoStart` | `true` | Start the server automatically when the Player boots (requires `enableInBuilds`). |
| `port` | `0` | Listen port. `0` = auto-assign from `7900`–`7949`. |
| `requestTimeoutMs` | `30000` | Per-request timeout. |
| `enableAuditLogging` | `true` | Log remote requests for auditing. |
| `maxWorkItemsPerFrame` | `10` | Dispatcher work items processed per frame. |

If `autoStart` is off, drive the server manually via `RuntimePipelineBootstrap.Instance` — the driver `RuntimeInitializeOnLoadMethod` already created at boot — and call `StartServer()`/`StopServer()` on it. `RuntimePipelineBootstrap.Bootstrap()` is idempotent (a second call returns the existing instance rather than creating a duplicate), so it's also safe to call directly if you're not sure whether bootstrap has run yet.

### Generated build-only assets

Each build generates two **transient** assets under `Assets/Settings/Pipeline/Resources/`, both deleted again once the build finishes:

- `RuntimePipelineConfig.asset` — your current settings, baked in so the Player can find them (the authored copy stays in `ProjectSettings/`, never here).
- `RuntimePipelineBuildInfo.asset` — the code-reload allowlist: absolute paths to `Assets/` plus every loaded package's resolved location, captured at build time because a running Player can't resolve the project layout on its own. Read by `RuntimePipelineBootstrap` at boot; absent (e.g. Play Mode without ever having built) just means no code-reload roots are allowed, not an error.

Neither should ever be committed — add this to your project's `.gitignore`:

```
/Assets/Settings/Pipeline/Resources/RuntimePipelineConfig.asset*
/Assets/Settings/Pipeline/Resources/RuntimePipelineBuildInfo.asset*
```

A build interrupted mid-way (crash, force-quit) can leave either behind; if you see them in `git status` after such an interruption, it's safe to delete them. The next build you run will also delete them itself, at the very start of preprocessing, before anything else — so a leftover from an interrupted build can never get packaged into a later Player, even one built with `enableInBuilds` off.

## Development-build gating

The runtime server, code evaluation, and code reload are all gated behind a compile-time guard:

```csharp
#if UNITY_EDITOR || (UNITY_STANDALONE && DEBUG)
```

`DEBUG` is defined for **standalone Development Builds** only. In a non-development (release) build the compilation/eval/code-reload code is compiled out entirely, so it cannot run — even if `enableInBuilds` is `true`. To use the runtime server in a Player you therefore need **both**:

1. A **Development Build** (defines `DEBUG`), built for a **standalone** target (Windows/macOS/Linux).
2. `enableInBuilds = true` in Project Settings → Pipeline → Runtime.

## Step-by-step: enable in a dev build

1. Open **Project Settings → Pipeline → Runtime**.
2. Tick **`enableInBuilds`**. Leave `autoStart` on and `port` at `0` (auto).
3. Open **File → Build Settings** and enable **Development Build** for a **Standalone** platform.
4. Build and run the Player.
5. On start, the bootstrap creates a `RuntimePipelineServer`, which binds the first free port in `7900`–`7949` and writes the runtime descriptor `.unity-pipeline-runtime-port` (with `port` and `evalToken`).
6. Connect a client using that port and token.

## Security

The runtime server applies the same protections as the editor server (see [Connectivity](connectivity.md)):

- It binds the **IPv4 loopback** (`http://127.0.0.1:<port>/`, plus the `localhost` hostname), so it is reachable only from the same machine and never exposed on a routable interface. Clients should connect to `127.0.0.1` explicitly — see [Loopback-only binding](connectivity.md#loopback-only-binding) for why `localhost` can resolve to the IPv6 loopback (`::1`), which Unity's Mono `HttpListener` cannot serve.
- Every request must present `Authorization: Bearer <evalToken>`; the token is generated at startup and published in the runtime descriptor.

Because the server exposes code evaluation and code reload, only enable it in development/QA builds — never in a production build without additional safeguards.
