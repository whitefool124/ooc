# Editor lifecycle & observability commands

Commands to control Editor play mode, focus, and menus, and to observe the Editor's state, console, and performance.

### `editor_play`
Enter Unity Editor play mode.

No parameters.

**Returns:** `string`

### `editor_stop`
Exit Unity Editor play mode.

No parameters.

**Returns:** `string`

### `editor_pause`
Toggle pause state of Unity Editor play mode (calling it again while paused resumes play mode).

No parameters.

**Returns:** `string`

### `editor_status`
Get detailed Unity Editor status and state information.

No parameters.

**Returns:** `StatusResponse`

### `editor_focus`
Bring the Unity Editor window to the foreground.

No parameters.

**Returns:** `string`
**Notes:** `MainThreadRequired = true`.

### `menu`
Execute an Editor menu item by path, or list available items when no path is given.

| Parameter | Required | Default | Description |
|-----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `path` | no | `–` | Menu item path to execute, e.g. "Assets/Reimport All". Omit to list available menu items. |

**Returns:** `MenuResponse`
**Notes:** `MainThreadRequired = true`.

### `screenshot`
Capture the Scene or Game view as a PNG and return its file path.

| Parameter | Required | Default | Description |
|-----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `view` | no | `game` | Which view to capture: 'game' (default) or 'scene' |
| `output` | no | `–` | Output PNG path (absolute, or relative to the project root). Defaults to a timestamped file under <project>/Temp/pipeline-screenshots/. |
| `width` | no | `0` | Output width in pixels. 0 (default) uses the view camera's current width. |
| `height` | no | `0` | Output height in pixels. 0 (default) uses the view camera's current height. |

**Returns:** `ScreenshotResponse`
**Notes:** `MainThreadRequired = true`.

### `set_autotick`
Keep the editor ticking while unfocused by forcing EditorApplication.SignalTick at a throttled rate.

| Parameter | Required | Default | Description |
|-----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `enable` | no | `true` | Enable (true) or disable (false) auto-tick mode |
| `interval_ms` | no | `16` | Minimum milliseconds between forced ticks. 0 = every update (max rate, pegs a CPU core). Default 16 (~60Hz). |
| `persist` | no | `true` | Persist this choice to SessionState so it survives a domain reload. Set `false` for a one-off/expensive setting (e.g. `interval_ms=0`) that should revert to the last persisted choice (or the default) after the next recompile instead of sticking for the rest of the session. |

**Returns:** `string`
**Notes:** `MainThreadRequired = true`. Persisted in SessionState by default: your enabled/interval choice survives a domain reload (dies with the editor process/session).

Use `persist=false` for a change you only want in effect until the next unrelated recompile — e.g. a short profiling run at `interval_ms=0` (pegs a CPU core) or a one-off test/CI script — so it can't outlive its purpose and silently burn CPU for the rest of the session. Leave `persist` at its default `true` for a setting you want to remain in effect across recompiles, such as the normal always-on 16ms tick.

### `get_performance_stats`
Read render, memory, and frame-timing stats (structured, read-only).

No parameters.

**Returns:** `PerformanceStats`

### `audit`
Run a Project Auditor static-analysis scan. Returns immediately; poll `audit_status` until status is `completed`, then read the CSV.

| Parameter | Required | Default | Description |
|-----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `categories` | no | `–` | Comma-separated issue categories to scan (e.g. `Code,ProjectSetting,Texture`). Default: all categories. An unknown name is rejected with an error listing the valid values. |
| `output` | no | `–` | CSV output path (absolute, or relative to the project root). Defaults to `<project>/Temp/pipeline-audit/<scanId>.csv`. |

**Returns:** `object` — `{ status, scanId, csvPath }` on start, or `{ status: "unavailable" | "error" | "busy", message }`.
**Notes:** Requires Project Auditor in the Editor. Only one scan runs at a time (a second call returns `busy`). Not cancellable: stop polling to abandon a scan.

### `audit_status`
Get the status of the last audit: `idle` | `scanning` | `completed` | `failed` | `interrupted` | `unavailable`.

No parameters.

**Returns:** `AuditStatus` (JSON) — `issueCount` and `csvPath` are populated when `completed`; `error` when `failed`; `message` when `unavailable`.
**Notes:** `MainThreadRequired = false`, so it answers while a scan holds the main thread (Code analysis compiles assemblies). `interrupted` means a domain reload killed an in-flight scan — re-run `audit`.

#### Project Auditor prerequisites

`audit` needs both Project Auditor **and** its rules:

- **Project Auditor absent** — `audit` returns `unavailable` immediately.
- **Rules absent** — when Project Auditor ships as a built-in editor module, its rules (descriptors,
  API/obsolete databases, Roslyn analyzers) come from the separate `com.unity.project-auditor-rules`
  package. Without it Project Auditor registers no analysis modules and cannot analyze anything, so
  `audit` returns `scanning` and the first `audit_status` poll reports `unavailable` with a message
  naming the package to install. It never reports an empty `completed` scan, which would read as a
  clean project.

The CSV columns are `Category, Severity, Areas, Description, RelativePath, Line, DescriptorId, Recommendation`;
only diagnostics (things to fix) are emitted, not raw inventory rows.

### `report_evals`
Aggregate the local eval-usage telemetry into a ranked report: API fingerprint frequency, one-liner percentage, error rate, and command-coverage suggestions (read-only). See [Eval usage telemetry](#eval-usage-telemetry) below.

| Parameter | Required | Default | Description |
|-----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `top` | no | `50` | Maximum entries in each ranked list: the fingerprint ranking and the uncovered patterns suggested as commands. Accepted range: 0 or greater; negative values fall back to the default. |

**Returns:** `EvalUsageReport`
**Notes:** `MainThreadRequired = false` (stays servable while the Editor is settling). Reads `<project>/Library/Pipeline/eval-usage.jsonl` merged with the rotated `eval-usage.old.jsonl` (oldest first), so the report covers the full retained history — bounded to roughly 2× the size cap. Returns a zeroed report if no evals have been recorded. The report's `distinctFingerprints` field carries the uncapped total of distinct fingerprints so truncation of the ranked list is always visible; coverage suggestions are computed from the full ranking, not the capped list.

## Eval usage telemetry

The `eval`/`eval_file` commands are the workhorse of autonomous agent sessions, but they are opaque: raw C# through the protocol, unauditable, and hard to displace with typed commands without knowing what agents actually run. This telemetry closes that loop by recording, **locally**, what each eval does — so the [eval-displacement epic (AUTHAPI-24)](https://jira.unity3d.com/browse/AUTHAPI-24) can be triaged from data instead of anecdotes.

### What is recorded, and where

Every `eval`/`eval_file` invocation appends one JSON object (one line, JSONL) to `<project>/Library/Pipeline/eval-usage.jsonl`:

| Field | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `time` | ISO-8601 UTC timestamp. |
| `command` | `eval` or `eval_file`. |
| `success` / `error` | Whether it succeeded; short error category on failure. |
| `payloadLength` / `lineCount` | Size/shape of the eval body. |
| `executionTimeMs` | How long it took. |
| `classification` | `single-expression` (a one-liner: one invoke / read / assignment) or `statements` (multi-statement bodies, e.g. polling loops, bulk setup). |
| `fingerprints` | The top-level member-access paths from the syntax tree — e.g. `AssetDatabase.Refresh`, `PlayerSettings.SetScriptingBackend`, `Object.FindFirstObjectByType<T>`, `MatchManager.Instance.State`. Rendering is a strict whitelist: the only source text that can appear in a fingerprint is an identifier, type name, or member name. Literals, interpolated strings, and any other expression form are replaced by the neutral `<expr>` placeholder (`"…".Length` records as `<expr>.Length`); object creations record as `new TypeName` (constructor arguments never appear); casts unwrap to the inner expression; generic type arguments normalise to `<T>`. A fingerprint that would be nothing but the placeholder is dropped. |
| `source` | The raw eval source — **absent by default**; present only when the opt-in below is enabled, and truncated at 64 K characters with an explicit `…[truncated]` marker (`payloadLength` still reports the full length). |

**Local-first, privacy-first, editor-only.** Nothing is transmitted off the machine, and nothing is recorded outside the Editor: player builds — including development players, where eval itself is available — never write telemetry (recording compiles to a no-op there). The fingerprint is derived from the C# syntax tree, so the log captures *which APIs* agents reach for without capturing *what data* they operate on. Conditional-access chains (`a?.B.C`) are fingerprinted with `?.` normalised to `.` so they rank with their unconditional form. The fingerprint deliberately undercounts a few forms (arguments nested inside a chain's receiver call, bare object creations) — see the `EvalUsageFingerprinter` class doc for the full blind-spot list before treating absence as proof of non-use.

**Zero eval latency.** Recording is fire-and-forget: when an eval completes, the source and outcome plus the current settings are snapshotted, and the parse → fingerprint → append runs on a background thread from that snapshot — the eval response is never delayed by telemetry. The JSONL is bounded by a size cap and rotates to `eval-usage.old.jsonl`; the rotated file is merged back into `report_evals`, so retained history is bounded to roughly 2× the cap.

### Settings

Configured on the `EditorPipelineManager` settings asset (`Window/Pipeline/Settings...`). Edits apply live from the inspector, and the stored values are re-applied on every server start:

- **Eval Telemetry Enabled** (default on) — master switch. When off, nothing is recorded (and, as always, nothing is transmitted).
- **Store Eval Source** (default off) — the explicit opt-in to also persist the raw eval `source` in each record, for local debugging only.

### The feedback loop: report → backlog triage

Run `report_evals` to aggregate the log into an `EvalUsageReport`:

- **Ranked fingerprints** with counts — what agents actually eval, most-used first.
- **One-liner percentage** and **error rate** — the shape of eval usage (the evidence base for AUTHAPI-24 is that ~80% of eval calls are one-liners).
- **Coverage suggestions** — each fingerprint is cross-referenced against the live command catalog:
  - `covered`: patterns already served by an existing command (e.g. `PlayerSettings.SetScriptingBackend` → `set_player_settings`) — these are habit, and should move off eval.
  - `topUncovered`: the highest-frequency patterns with no covering command (e.g. `AssetDatabase.Refresh` → proposed `refresh_assets`) — these are the next typed commands to build ([AUTHAPI-17](https://jira.unity3d.com/browse/AUTHAPI-17)).

This turns backlog triage into a lookup: "12× `AssetDatabase.Refresh`, no command → build it; 60× state-read loops → `wait_for`". Re-run across sessions to demonstrate eval's shrinking share as typed commands land.

### `get_authoring_root`
Get the base folder (under Assets/) that bare authoring paths resolve against.

No parameters.

**Returns:** `object`

### `set_authoring_root`
Set the base folder (under Assets/) that bare authoring paths resolve against and are confined to. Use 'Assets' for full project access.

| Parameter | Required | Default | Description |
|-----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `root` | yes | `–` | Project-relative folder under Assets/, e.g. Assets/AgentWork. Use 'Assets' to allow the whole project. |

**Returns:** `object`
