    /// Why this is non-trivial:
    ///  - Unity only runs script compilation while the editor is the active OS application. Pass
    ///    focus=true to bring it to the foreground (editor_focus) before AssetDatabase.Refresh();
    ///    it is off by default because the server keeps the editor ticking while unfocused, so
    ///    compilation still proceeds without stealing the user's foreground window.
    ///  - A successful compile triggers a domain reload, which destroys the managed AppDomain
    ///    (HTTP server, in-flight requests, statics). The triggering request therefore cannot stay
    ///    open and return when done.
    ///
    /// Pattern (mirrors the test runner): completion is reported via a status file that survives the
    /// domain reload. Call "recompile" to trigger, then poll "recompile_status" until status is
    /// "completed" or "up_to_date". The client must tolerate connection errors during the reload.
    ///
    /// The status file is not sufficient on its own: a failed editor compile suppresses the domain
    /// reload entirely, and the file lives under Temp/, which Unity deletes at every editor launch.
    /// Both commands therefore also consult the compile-failure flag Unity keeps natively.
