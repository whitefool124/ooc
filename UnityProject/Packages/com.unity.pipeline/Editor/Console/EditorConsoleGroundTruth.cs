    ///    the only observable symptom of the log-callback subscription having been dropped, and
    ///    re-arms capture when it sees it.
    ///
    /// Sampling runs on <see cref="EditorApplication.update"/> rather than
    /// <see cref="ConsoleWindowUtility.consoleLogsChanged"/>, because that event is raised from
    /// ConsoleWindow.LogChanged, which returns early when no Console window exists — precisely the
