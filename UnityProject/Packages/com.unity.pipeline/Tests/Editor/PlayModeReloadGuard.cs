    /// the Test Runner window. The project's original Enter Play Mode settings are stashed in
    /// <see cref="SessionState"/> (which survives a domain reload, should one still slip through) and
    /// restored when the run ends.

    /// Note: this only governs the reload performed when ENTERING play mode. A test that explicitly
    /// recompiles (e.g. RequestScriptReload) would still reload — that is a different mechanism.
