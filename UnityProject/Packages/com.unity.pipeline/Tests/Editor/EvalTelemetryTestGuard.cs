// No namespace on purpose: an NUnit [SetUpFixture] outside any namespace runs its OneTimeSetUp /

/// <summary>
/// Redirects <see cref="EvalUsageTelemetry.OverrideDirectory"/> to a throwaway temp directory for the
/// entire EditMode run. Many suites run evals through the live server without going near the telemetry
/// fixtures (JobEndpointTests, ApiEndpointsTests, code-reload suites, …); without this suite-level
/// redirect each of those evals would append a record to the REAL project's
/// <c>Library/Pipeline/eval-usage.jsonl</c>, polluting the dogfood telemetry with test noise. The
/// telemetry-specific fixtures keep their own per-fixture redirects — they save this fixture's
/// directory in SetUp and restore it in TearDown, so the two layers compose.
///
/// The original override (normally null → the real Library/Pipeline) is restored and the temp
/// directory deleted in OneTimeTearDown, after draining any in-flight background records. Note: a
/// mid-run domain reload would reset the static override; like the other suite guards, this accepts
/// that narrow window rather than trying to survive it.
